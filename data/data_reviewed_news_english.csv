19,"During the first round of debates on the proposed Constitutional reforms yesterday (30), MP M.A.Sumanthiran urged the Constitutional Assembly not to squander the opportunity to solidify a united, discrimination free Sri Lanka and not put the lives of the future generations in peril.During his address MP Sumanthiran expressed the poignancy of the current juncture the Constitutional Assembly is faced with and appealed to all members to have an open mind and exercise foresight instead of impulse when deciding on the verdict of the Constitutional amendments.He further highlighted the importance of the current constitutional process stating that it was a Ã¢â‚¬ËœhistoricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ occasion as for the first time, a party representing the Tamil people has agreed to proposals brought forward by the government on the constitution.His statements are were as follows,Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity given to me to say a few words in this historic occasion. I say Ã¢â‚¬Å“historicÃ¢â‚¬Â because this is indeed the first time that a party representing the Tamil people of this country is agreeing with some proposals, although incomplete and still only at the stage of proposals. Yet, even with that it is agreeing.I was saying that this is the first time, even though it is only at a proposal stage, a party that is largely representative of the Tamil people of this country is agreeing with. I am saying because in the position paper that we have given, which is part of the Interim Report that has been placed before this Assembly for Debate for these three days, marked 1C, we have stated our positions very clearly and I want to elaborate on some of those now. But I want to draw the attention of the Assembly to the last point that we have made, point number 9. We say, I quote:Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the interest of reaching an acceptable consensus, the TNA will be willing to consider agreement with the main principles articulated in the interim report if the same are acceptable to the two main parties.Ã¢â‚¬ÂWe have said Ã¢â‚¬Å“two main partiesÃ¢â‚¬Â for the reason that as the Hon. Leader of the House correctly pointed out that any resolution to the national question so far was not possible because one or the other main party opposed it.Today, we have a historic opportunity. Not only are we saying that in the interest of reaching a consensus, we will be willing to consider the main points in the main report, but the two main parties are also together having formed a National Government primarily for the purpose of giving to this country a new Constitution.Sir, on this question of a new Constitution, there are many views that are being expressed in the country. At the Presidential Election that was conducted in 2015 January, the common opposition candidate made his position very clear that he will abolish the Executive Presidency. That was the first promise that he gave this country on the day that he announced himself as the common opposition candidate.He gave three promises. This was the first one. He also said that the electoral system will undergo a radical change. Now if these are to take place, those must have the approval of the people at a referendum and some of those changes were sought to be brought in through the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Supreme Court in its determination ruled that certain proposed amendments needed the approval of the people at a referendum.On the day the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was adopted in this House with only one Member voting against it, it was repeatedly assured by the then Minister of Justice who led the discussion during the Committee Stage and the Hon. Prime Minister that the Nineteenth Amendment was only a stopgap, it was only an interim arrangement and a new Constitution would be made when the new Parliament is constituted.This appears in the Hansard of that day several times in the speeches made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the then Minister of Justice and the Hon. Prime Minister. This was a promise given by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the UNP at the election.But it is not only that, on the 08th of January, 2015, the UPFA candidate, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, also said that he would enact a new Constitution for the country. His election manifesto states this and I quote from his election manifesto. It states, I quote:Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Wide Political Reform - A New Political CultureWe have been battered for 36 years by the 1978 Constitution which was thrust upon our people and country, without an appropriate debate or discussion. We must also collectively acknowledge that our Constitution is now further distorted due to the various amendments over the years, some of which are not consistent with others. Therefore, instead of amending the Constitution further with piece-meal changes, I will take action to formulate a new Constitution that reflects the peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ideas, aspirations and wishes, within a period of one year.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThen there are some bullet points where he says what he would do. I quote:Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The entire Parliament will be formed as a Constitutional Council consisting of peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ representatives belonging to all political parties, which will identify the peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ expectations and aspirations in order to formulate a new Constitution.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThat is exactly what you have done, Sir. The entire Parliament has been converted into a Constitutional Assembly. I quote further:Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ I will appoint a CitizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Advisory Council consisting of representatives of political parties who are not members of the Parliament, representatives of the youth parliament, Constitutional experts, intellectuals and professionals, in order to seek citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ views and recommendations for the new Constitution.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThirdly it states, I quote:Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ I will first submit the Draft Constitution which will consist of the proposals of these groups, for the ParliamentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approval in accordance with the Constitution. Thereafter, I will present the Draft Constitution to a referendum seeking the approval of the people.Ã¢â‚¬ÂI want to table, in the House, that page of the Hon. Mahinda RajapaksaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s election manifesto in January, 2015.Therefore, the mandate of the people of this country is overwhelming. Ninety seven per cent of those who voted on the 15th of January, 2015 have voted for a new Constitution to be formulated by converting this House into a Constitutional Assembly and enact a new Constitution for this country. He said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã Â·Æ’Ã Â¶Â·Ã Â·ÂÃ Â·â‚¬,Ã¢â‚¬Â it states, Ã¢â‚¬Å“CouncilÃ¢â‚¬Â in the English translation of his manifesto, which is the same thing.Never before has there been such a massive mandate. Now a few individuals who stand on the streets are trying to deny the 97 per cent of the people of this country their right to enact a new Constitution. Where in the world you have a mandate of 97 per cent of their people telling their representatives to enact a new Constitution for the country?That is a mandate upon which a new Resolution to form a Constitutional Assembly was placed in this Parliament on the 09th of January, 2016. That was debated. That was debated on four separate occasions: on the 09th of January, 2016, two dates in February and finally on the 09th of March, 2016. On the 09th of March, 2016 that Resolution was adopted in this House unanimously - without a vote. Until then, there was a good professor of law, who has now become a president of a new political party, who was holding press conferences saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you start a process to draft a new Constitution that would be illegal.Ã¢â‚¬Â But, after the 09th of March, 2016, he has not said a word about that, because persons who are aligned with his new political party are also Members of this House who did not murmur, did not raise one voice and did not ask for a Division when that Resolution was adopted. That Resolution was adopted in terms of Articles 74 and 75 of the current Constitution and that was what Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Presidential candidate also said; in line with the present Constitution that he would draft a new Constitution Bill and present it to this House.The Resolution that we adopted unanimously lays down the procedure very clearly as to what will happen. It talks about a Steering Committee consisting of 21 Members; it talks about a Committee of Experts; it talks about six Subcommittees; it talks about an Interim Report that we presented to this Assembly and then, it talks about a Final Report together with a Draft Constitution Bill. A Draft Constitution Bill has a particular meaning in our Constitution. A Draft Constitution Bill is one that seeks to repeal the current Constitution and replace it with that Draft Bill. That is what it means.Article 74 (1) of the Constitution states, I quote:Ã¢â‚¬Å“ .... Parliament may by resolution .... provide for -(ii) Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ matter for which provision is required or authorized to be so made by the Constitution.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThen, Article 75 (b) states, I quote:Ã¢â‚¬Å“repealing the Constitution as a whole unless such law also enacts a new Constitution to replace it.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThat is, Parliament shall not make any law repealing the Constitution as a whole, such law also enacts a new Constitution.So, the procedure to adopt a new Constitution, repeal the current Constitution and replace it with the new Constitution, is provided for in Article 75 and Article 74 (1) (ii) that authorizes Parliament by Resolution to adopt the procedure for it. And, that is a procedure that is laid down in the Resolution that formed this Constitutional Assembly on the 9th of March which was adopted unanimously. So, all of these public utterances saying that there is no mandate of the people to draft a new Constitution, that this Constitutional Assembly is illegal, none of which stands the test of what has been written and what has been resolved by this House.So, all the Hon. Members of this House had the opportunity to call for a Division to object to that Resolution but none of them did so. All the steps in that Resolution were being followed to the letter. The Steering Committee was appointed unanimously by the Constitutional Assembly. Every expert was named was approved unanimously by this Assembly.The Members and Chairmen of every Subcommittee were approved unanimously by this Assembly. No one dissented; not a single Member dissented. And all different political parties have been accommodated in the Steering Committee. That, and the level of participation are borne out by the Steering Committee Minutes. Since I am a Member of the Steering Committee, I have the Minutes here with me. If we take the level of participation, the Hon. Leader of the House was pleased to thank a certain Member in the Opposition ranks and these Minutes will show how much he and the other Member from his side have been involved in the deliberations of the Steering Committee. Almost, I would say, 20 per cent or more of the entire contents of the Minutes are about their participation.Once, there was a complaint made that some MembersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ views had not been accepted by a certain Subcommittee. A letter was sent to the Steering Committee. So, on the 26th of October, those two Members, who were Members of the Subcommittee on Law and Order, were invited by the Steering Committee. The Minutes of that meeting state that they said the Chairman of the Subcommittee was very fair, but they had certain views, that they could not agree with some of the views in the Report of that Subcommittee. And the decision was, I quote from the Minutes of the 33rd Steering Committee Meeting, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hon. Prime Minister requested the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa and the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe to submit their views in writing to the Steering Committee within a week as the Subcommittees are now defunct.Ã¢â‚¬Â So, they were given yet another opportunity saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“All right, if you do have other views, submit those in writing.Ã¢â‚¬Â They agreed, but nothing came to the Steering Committee from those two Members.These are the Minutes. They were present before the Steering Committee, but they did not send in their views. -[Interruption.]The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, who disturbs me now, signed and gave his own proposal to the Steering Committee, which, after some time, another Member of the Steering Committee, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, said he was withdrawing. It has all been minuted.So, I am saying it now in the public because giving a different view to the public that some people have nothing to do with this is false and all of this has been considered.Now, Sir, coming to the position that our party has taken, I want to say a few words before I conclude. We have very clearly stated that Sri Lanka shall be a secular State and I say this with responsibility: any Constitution that seeks to treat all of its citizens as its equals must be a secular Constitution. I am not a Buddhist and I cannot be told that I am second class in this country. A Constitution that gives a particular religion the foremost place cannot be a Constitution that treats all of its citizens as equals.Now, it is up to this House to decide whether you want a Constitution that does not treat all of its citizens equally. Even having said that that should be the ideal, we have gone on to say, but, if the Buddhist people wish that a certain status be given to Buddhism, we will not stand in the way.But, it is an indefensible position for the Buddhists to take. We, who are non-Buddhists, are saying, we do not mind it being given a foremost place. But, how will a Buddhist say our religion must have the foremost place; others can have other places? How can any Buddhist who defend equality ever stand up and say that? But yet, if you want it, we have said, we are willing to grant it.We have very clearly said that Sri Lanka must be a federation - a Federal State. I want to say a few things about this idea of a Federal State. There is a wrong conception or a wrong view that has been spread in this country that the call for federalism comes from the Tamil people because they want to separate from this country. Nothing can be furthest from the truth. The federal idea was introduced to this country by the founder of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1926. There were six letters that he wrote to Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ceylon Morning LeaderÃ¢â‚¬Â on federalism.Not only that, the Left of this country in 1944 held the same view. Even before that, the Communist Party made a resolution that the country must be federal. The Pieter Keuneman - A. Vaidialingam Report of the Communist Party of 1944 very clearly articulates that Ceylon must be a federal country. Sir, I am tabling the Pieter Keuneman - A. Vaidialingam Report of the Communist Party also.I am saying all of this to show that the call for federalism came from Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Mr. Pieter Keuneman, Mr. A. Vaidialingam and more importantly, from the Kandyan Chiefs in the 1930s before the Donoughmore Commission and later in the 1940s, before the Soulbury Commission. They articulated three units with the North and East as one unit.So, those who oppose federalism and those who oppose the North and East Province as one unit must remember that that proposal came from the Kandyans first, not once, but twice before two imperial commissions. So, you all must disabuse your minds of the view that this is somehow a Tamil project, a first step to separation. No, Sir, we have very clearly stated that the country must remain one.We have said that very clearly. We are participating in this process in the most responsible way possible and we ourselves have said that the country must remain one. Our view is that if the country is to remain one, different peoples in this country must have a share of the governance of this country. It cannot be a system of government in which simple majoritarian rule prevails.This country consists of different peoples and it is in order to remain as one that we are seeking maximum possible devolution of power; maximum possible power sharing arrangement so that all the peoples in this country have a share in that. Otherwise, sovereignty, which is said to rest in the people, will become meaningless; sovereignty will be exercised only by one majority, one people of this country, if it is a simple majoritarian rule.So, one must understand, the country must understand, the reason why we are asking for sharing of power. The reason why we are asking for sharing of power is so that we can be proud of this one country of which we are citizens. We do not want to be second-class citizens. Nobody in the world wants to be second-class citizens in any part of the world. If we are to be proud of this country, we must have equal stake in this country.We must be able to say we are proud to be Sri Lankans. I must be able to say I have equal access to government power and I am treated as an equal in this country. Until we are treated as equals, not by mere words, but actual access to government power being given to our people, we will never be in a position to say we are proud of this country; we will never be in a position to say we are Sri Lankans.Many in our community have left this country today and they are not proud to call themselves Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sri LankansÃ¢â‚¬Â. They call themselves Ã¢â‚¬Å“Canadian-TamilsÃ¢â‚¬Â, they call themselves Ã¢â‚¬Å“Australian-TamilsÃ¢â‚¬Â, because they have been driven out by violence from this country. They have been denied the due share that they must have in the government of this country.That must change. The reason why the Tamil National Alliance participates to this level in this Constitution-making process is to change that, to erase that bitter past so that we can, together with you, say our language is equal - that was corrected in 1987 but must be implemented in full - our religions are equal, no foremost place to anybody, everybody is foremost in this country; we must be able to say we have due share in the governance structures of this country.Now, these are proposals, none of these proposals that are being placed here have gone beyond anything that the seven Chief Ministers and their Opposition Leaders other than the North East Provincial Council made before the Steering Committee. All of the Chief Ministers in the seven other provinces, other than the North East, want sharing of power. They came before the Steering Committee. All of those are matters of record. They want law and order, they want land powers, they want the powers of the Governor reduced.I am saying this because one must remember that in 1987 when the Thirteenth Amendment was being passed, several Opposition MPs, then the SLFP, gathered at Pettah, outside the bus stand and performed a hartal. They said the country is going to be divided by this Thirteenth Amendment. Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was there personally leading the protest saying if this Amendment is passed, the country will be divided. He is the one, as the Leader of the House stated, who repeatedly said when he came into power, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will implement the Thirteenth Amendment in full and go beyond it and make power sharing meaningful.Ã¢â‚¬ÂToday when the provincial council elections are postponed, it is he and Members associated with him who are protesting and saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do not postpone the provincial council elections.Ã¢â‚¬Â The man who said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Country will divide if you create provincial councilsÃ¢â‚¬Â, is screaming his head off today saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do not postpone provincial council elections. That is the violation of our sovereigntyÃ¢â‚¬Â. Professor GL PeirisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ petition to the Supreme Court on which the Determination on the Twentieth Amendment was made, was made on the basis that a postponement of the provincial council election affects the sovereignty of the people and they do not want it postponed. So, the creation of provincial councils has not resulted in the country being divided. The country has not been divided.I also have with me the 2000 August Draft Constitution Bill that was brought to this House by the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alliance Government of that day of which the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was a Cabinet Minister; a Bill which was certified by the Cabinet of Ministers as a Bill that is intended to be passed by this Parliament by a two-thirds majority and approved by the people at a referendum. He was a Cabinet Minister who approved of this Bill and what does that Bill say? These proposals before us today say, we are one country. Therefore, we can call ourselves, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã Â¶â€™Ã Â¶Å¡Ã Â·â€œÃ Â¶Âº Ã Â¶Â»Ã Â¶Â¢Ã Â¶ÂºÃ¢â‚¬Â, meaning of which will say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã Â®â€™Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯Â Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Å¸Ã Â¯ÂÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã Â®â€™Ã Â®Â°Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â®Ã Â®Â¿Ã Â®Â¤Ã Â¯ÂÃ Â®Â¤ Ã Â®Â¨Ã Â®Â¾Ã Â®Å¸Ã Â¯ÂÃ¢â‚¬Â - Ã¢â‚¬Å“one country.Ã¢â‚¬Â This does not even say that. This says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sri Lanka is a Union of RegionsÃ¢â‚¬Â. All the Cabinet Ministers at that time supported this, in this House.The UNP supported that principle. The UNP burned a copy of this Bill in this House because there was a transitional provision with regard to the Executive Presidency, not because of power sharing, not because of change of status of the country.There was a wide consensus not only in August, 2000. Thereafter, when the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa became the President of this country, he formed the APRC. He told the APRC that there must be maximum possible devolution in his speech when he addressed the inaugural session of the APRC. Where is the APRC Report? The APRC Report says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do not have a Concurrent List.Ã¢â‚¬Â It says not to have a Concurrent List and that powers must be clearly divided. That is the Report that came out of a process that the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as President instituted. But what do our proposals say? We say, we have no objection to a short Concurrent List. Now, why do you say that the country is going to be divided by this?When you were in power you approved of a Draft Bill that went far beyond, far beyond what is contemplated by this Interim Report. Is it not to mislead the people of this country, and stall, and prevent a final resolution to the national question that has plagued this country ever since Independence? Do we not want a reasonable resolution of this? If you ask the question what is the biggest problem this country has faced, obviously it is the national question. This country has not faced a war for three decades on account of anything else, not on account of any other issue, it is only in regard to these issues that actually parts of the country were ruled by others also for parts of time. So, we are now in a process.As responsible representatives of our people, we are Tamil Members of Parliament from the North and East - except two, all others belong to the Tamil National Alliance - we have an overwhelming mandate from our people to resolve this question within a united, undivided country and we have gone one step further and said, indivisible country even in the future. So, when we are participating like that, our people have misgivings of this Interim Report. Our people are saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We told you it must be a Federal StateÃ¢â‚¬Â. Our people are saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“There must be one unit of devolutionÃ¢â‚¬Â. Our people are saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It must be a Secular State, is it not a reasonable thing? You are compromising beyond the mandate that we have given youÃ¢â‚¬Â. They are right. We do not want to compromise beyond the mandate given to us, but we want to see that through negotiation a reasonable position is reached. Even at this point in time, it looks as so.From our peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view it looks as so we are going beyond the mandate given to us. We are striving hard to achieve a consensus which we will put before our people, which, if we are satisfied, is a reasonable solution that addresses all the basic aspirations of our people. Then, we will go before our people; we will commend it to our people to accept it and our people will accept it if it addresses those issues.We had two full-day meetings yesterday. Our representatives had lots of misgivings about various matters in this Report. We will address them as we go along. But, our primary objective would be to come to a consensus in this country, so that there will be a Constitution of this country which all the people of this country accept as their own. Is that too much to ask? Can anything be said to be too heavy a burden to carry if we are to achieve that? All of us must put our shoulder to the wheel if we can achieve that objective. I am not saying that it is an easy objective to achieve, but we have come half way. We have come to a point where there is an Interim Report on which - although we disagree on lots of matters - we have clearly come out and said, if the main points are agreed to by the two main parties, we will consider agreement with that for the sake of consensus and for the future generations of our country.I invite all the Hon. Members of this Assembly - I am not saying this patronizingly, I am pleading with every Member of this Assembly to please, view this matter in that way. Do not put the lives of future generations of this country at peril.Think of what this country will be if we can achieve this. Of course, it must be achieved in a way that recognizes the dignity, equality of all the peoples of this country.Otherwise we will not agree. But, there is an opportunity to come to an agreement such as that and this AssemblyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deliberations today, tomorrow and the day after must be for that constructive purpose to go into the contents, place different propositions, listen to every shade of view and then, tell the Steering Committee, that you have heard all of this.Bring all this to fruition so that this country can march forward as one entity in which various, different people who speak a different language, who profess a different religion, who live in different parts of this country can all say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are Sri Lankans.Ã¢â‚¬Â because our rights, our dignity, our equality have been assured in this document and this is our document.Thank you very much.",NOT RELEVANT,TAMIL,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=43897,37,,Tamil,News
23,"Tamils continue to face discrimination in Sri Lanka, a UN committee stated recently, and questioned the island-country if Indian Tamils were allowed to get back to their homeland Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while reviewing a report on the anti-discrimination efforts undertaken by the country.No cases of sexual violence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ during the horrific civil war in Sri Lanka Ã¢â‚¬â€œ had been submitted, even though this had affected thousands of women, said Jose Francisco Cali Tzay, committee member and country rapporteur for Sri Lanka, during a review of Sri Lanka in the 90th session of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).Last week, CERD concluded the examination of the combined tenth to seventeenth periodic report of Sri Lanka Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on its implementation of provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).The Tamil population continues to suffer discrimination, including through lack of access to public services in their own language, and the fact that police agents in the north of the country did not speak Tamil, he noted. People continue to live in fear due to the big military presence.The recently-promulgated Law for Witness and Victim Protection had no dedicated funds for the mechanism to facilitate its implementation on the ground.What measures have been taken to protect Tamil women from multiple discrimination, the Guatemalan expert who has been on the Committee since 2004, asked, warning that discrimination against Tamils, particularly for not having access to public spaces to bury their dead would continue to hinder lasting peace and reconciliation.Since 2009, there have been several issues that have remained unaddressed, brought about by violations of humanitarian laws and human rights by both sides, leading to anxiety, fear and suspicion, said Ravinatha Aryasinha, Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UN office at Geneva, while presenting his country report. Successive governments have failed to reach a political settlement with the groups.Aryasinha referred to the various steps that have been taken since the Maithripala Sirisena government assumed power in January 2015, including the introduction of the nineteenth amendment to the Constitution Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which imposed a two-term limit for the mandate of President and recognized national reconciliation as a duty of the President. The amendment also established a special Presidential Task Force on Reconciliation and an Office for National Unity Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation that would consult with South African authorities.Both Sinhala and Tamil were made the languages of administration and of the courts, he added. Article 22, per the provisions of the 16th amendment to the Constitution, ensures that Sinhala will be the official language in all provinces except in the north and east where Tamil will also be used.Replying to questions by experts on application of customary laws, the Sri Lankan delegation said that any change of customary law had to change from the communities themselves. As such, those people of Islamic faith have the option of subscribing to Muslim personal laws (including statutes) while Tamils hailing from the Jaffna Peninsula fall within the ambit of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœThesavalame LawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Any Sri Lankan had the right to return Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the Government had re-established the possibility for dual citizenships Ã¢â‚¬â€œ said the Sri Lankan delegation, replying to a question from a human rights expert that if Indian Tamils were allowed to return to their country.The CERD members said that the situation of refugees and internally displaced persons, war widows, inter-ethnic violence, reconciliation, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and the lack of human rights education were all Ã¢â‚¬Å“issues of concernÃ¢â‚¬Â for the Committee.Reports presented by civil society organisations and the UN human rights mechanisms along with UN resolutions, offered a very different picture of the current situation than that presented by the Sri Lankan government Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the discrepancies were concerning, Tzay stated.The UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. MÃƒÂ©ndez, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, MÃƒÂ³nica Pinto, were on an official visit to the Buddhist nation this year.Both the experts had said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“more reforms are needed before Sri Lanka can be considered to be on a path to sustainable democratisationÃ¢â‚¬Â.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Severe forms of torture continue to be used, although probably less frequently, while both old and new cases of torture continue to be surrounded by total impunity,Ã¢â‚¬Â MÃƒÂ©ndez had said.Reiterating her concerns on the issue of massive rape by the military, a CERD expert noted that many of the perpetrators were still in the north of the country, and emphasised the need for newly-recruited Tamil elements there.Experts were concerned about the 18-month period for pre-trial detention, and raised a number of questions in relation to the application of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suspects are subjected to lengthy remand periods with many being detained for years, some even up to 15 years before trial,Ã¢â‚¬Â MÃƒÂ©ndez had said after his Sri Lankan tour.The Act allows for arbitrary detention without charges, admissibility of statements obtained under duress in courts and limits access to a lawyer.The Sri Lankan government, however, maintained that persons arrested under the PTA were entitled to all safeguards, including visits by family members and the National Human Rights Commission.Questions were also raised by the UN committee on risks of political interference, referring specifically to the removal of judges for politically-motivated reasons, urging the country to adopt better provisions for ensuring the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.Pinto had also stated that the government needs to Ã¢â‚¬Å“reinforce the independence and impartiality of the justice sectorÃ¢â‚¬Â during the drafting of its new Constitution.This is the first interaction between the Sri Lankan government and the CERD experts since August 2001, when the last formal meeting took place in the midst of hostilities perpetrated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).CERD is a body of independent human experts monitoring the implementation of ICERD by the state parties. -AgenciesSource: Firstpost",WOMEN,TAMIL,Negative,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=36668,57,,Tamil,News
58,"Ninety five percent of Tamils living in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka have asked for a federal constitution, says S. Thavarasa, a member of the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Public Representations Committee (PRC) which interviewed thousands of citizens on what they would like to see in the new constitution that is to be drawn up soon.Refuting the reported contention of PRC chairman Lal Wijenayake, that most Tamils did not seek federalism, Thavarasa said that he could produce documentary proof to show that the North-East Tamils demanded federalism.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have copies of all the submissions,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told Express on Saturday.Wijenayake had made the statement attributed to him at a hurriedly convened press conference on Friday.Patali Champika Ranawka, a member of the Lankan cabinet and leader of the Sinhalese-rights party, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), recently asked the Tamils to give up the demand for federalism if they want a solution to the ethnic conflict.It is in view of the Sinhalese opposition to a federal constitution that S. ThavarasaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s party, the Eelam PeoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Democratic Party (EPDP), proposed to the PRC that a middle of the road solution may be sought if the Sinhalese parties give up their insistence on a Unitary constitution.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The EPDP suggested that a middle of the road structure, which is neither fully federal nor fully unitary, could be worked out if there is agreement that the controversial terms Ã¢â‚¬ËœfederalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœunitaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are not used,Ã¢â‚¬Â Thavarasa said.He pointed out that there is a thirst for devolution in all Sri Lankan provinces and not just in the minoritiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dominated Northern and Eastern Provinces.Ã¢â‚¬Å“At a conference of Chief Ministers called by the Prime Minister on July 9, all the six Chief Ministers who attended sought devolution as decreed by the 13th Constitutional amendment including power over lands and the police,Ã¢â‚¬Â Thavarasa said.The 13 th.Amendment enacted at the instance of India following the India-Lanka Accord of 1987, created elected Provincial Councils with powers over land and the police also. But powers over these two important subjects were never actually devolved, thus effectively crippling the Provincial Councils.Source: New Indian Express-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,TAMIL,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=36093,10,,Tamil,News
67,"The Indian Origin Tamils (IOT), who are 4.16 per cent of the Sri Lankan population of 20.3 million, are aiming to double their representation in a reformed Sri Lankan parliament.As on date, there are seven IOT MPs in the House of 225 members. The community is aiming to have up to 14 MPs in a parliament of 255 members to be elected under a new electoral system which is currently under discussion.IOT leader Mano Ganeshan told Express on Sunday that if justice is to be done to the long neglected community, there should be at least 10 elected IOT MPs. Besides, another four or five should get in through the national or bonus list. The IOT had lost representation down the years due to various factors. In 1949, when Lanka had just won independence, there were seven IOT MPs in a 95-member parliament. But representation was reduced to nil in the 1952 parliament, because only 5,000 of the 780,600 IOT had qualified for Lankan citizenship under the 1949 Citizenship Act.The population of the IOT subsequently got reduced because of the Sirima-Shastri and Sirima-Gandhi pacts in the 1960s and 1970s, which envisaged partial repatriation to India. It was only in 1988 that a substantial number of IOT got voting rights and it was only in 2003 that all of them got voting rights.Need For Fresh Delimitation But the envisaged increase in the IOTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parliamentary representation can be achieved only if there is a suitable delimitation of constituencies and the introduction of multi-member constituencies, Ganeshan said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is time fresh delimitation was done because the last delimitation took place in 1976 when most of the IOT were stateless and without a vote. Since then, there has also been an increase in population,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.IOT leaders are to meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will ask for multi-member constituencies and redrawing of constituencies in the districts of Nuwara Eliya, Colombo, Gampaha, Ratnapura and Badulla to get more of us into parliament,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.Source: New Indian Express",NOT RELEVANT,TAMIL,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=30725,10,,Tamil,News

73,"                   Washington, Feb 11, The United States should work with the Sri Lankan government to encourage transparency, accountability, and equal representation of Tamils, panelists agreed at an American Enterprise Institute event Friday. The conference focused on Sri Lankas troubled past and its prospects for future reconciliation and growth.Lisa Curtis of the Heritage Foundation expressed hope for tolerance and open debate between Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksas government and the Tamils. Curtis asserted that the United States should support the countrys significant economic growth and development, especially given Sri Lankas strategic maritime and geopolitical role in South Asia. Dan Camp of the US Foreign Service disagreed, stating that US engagement has been purely humanitarian, while Sri Lanka seeks to maintain good relations with the United States to secure a market for its exports.He added that while Tamils outside of Sri Lanka hope to attain greater retribution, local populations are, by necessity, more concerned with basic needs and material well-being. Karunyan Arulanantham, native Tamil and humanitarian activist, stressed that Tamil militancy and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam emerged only after a long history of hurt and conflict. Reconciliation would require the Sri Lankan government to become accountable to the Tamil people, to allow them due share of power, and to allow them to seek official recognition of war crimes.Jennifer Leonard of the International Crisis Group regrets that the eighteenth amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution has lifted all checks on the president, allowing Rajapaksa to stall devolution of power to the northern and eastern Tamil regions. While the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission hearings attempt to bring justice for ethnic Tamils, they are not an adequate forum to provide real accountability. Since the sympathies of most who have testified lie with the government, human rights infractions have not been adequately portrayed, states an American Enterprise Institute media release.

But now the proposed First Past The Post system is rejecting the rightsof minorities and also minor parties which get 5% and less, again with thisFPTP the Government is proposing that an individual who possesses charismacannot contest his own seat but has to seek a group and contest in allwards/electorates. Also Rs. 20,000 per person has been decided as a deposit,which is again a challenge to the democracy of a poorer person.In the North and the deep South, perhaps pan Sinhala or Tamildistricts may not be affected by this. But in multi-ethnic and multi-culturalsocieties like in Colombo,the minorities chances are narrowed down to win a seat only through 30% PR andmore than 5% cut off.

Once this is passed and becomes an Act, there will be one ormany district demarcation or delimitation committees.

438,"The Swiss Federal Criminal Court has given no prison terms to alleged financiers of the Sri Lankan Tamil separatist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE). The 13 accused were either given suspended custodial sentences or acquitted.The court on Thursday said accusations of participation in and support of a criminal organisation did not stand and released all of the accused.It noted that the hierarchical link between the LTTE and WTCC was not sufficiently established. The judges also felt there was not enough concrete proof to consider the LTTE as a criminal organisation.While the federal prosecutor Juliette Noto had asked for prison terms of between 18 months and six years for the accused, the court did not oblige. Eight of the thirteen on the docks were acquitted of all charges.The others were only found guilty of fraud. WTCCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finance manager and one of the accused who arranged loans from Bank Now (owned by Credit Suisse) on false pretences got a 24-month suspended sentence. The president of WTCC got 21 months while the finance managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy got 20 months in suspended sentences.The whole process is estimated to have cost close to CHF4 million (4.03 million) which the federal government will have to bear. In addition to this amount, compensation for those acquitted, as well as lawyersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fees total to almost CHF5 million. The accused will have to pay part of their lawyersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ expenses provided they have the financial means to do so.During the eight-week trial, which opened in January and closed in March, the federal prosecutor requested sentences of up to six-and-a-half years in prison. The proceedings cost CHF3.8 million ($3.85 million).The 13 defendants - 12 Tamils or Swiss citizens of Tamil origin plus one German - were accused of participating in or supporting a criminal organisation, fraud, forgery, money laundering and extortion.During her indictment, Juliette Noto, a federal prosecutor, described a sophisticated system used by the WTCC to raise funds largely for armed struggle from the Tamil community in Switzerland. The Tamil community in Switzerland was systematically registered and its ability to pay assessed. Families who refused to pay were threatened, she said.Noto cast the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE), who are represented in Switzerland by the WTCC, as a violent movement Ã¢â‚¬Å“whose effectiveness inspired Al-QaedaÃ¢â‚¬Â. Showing a picture of the WTCC leader behind a machine gun and images of child soldiers, she enumerated the attacks and crimes attributed to the Tamil Tigers.

The defence also challenged the prosecution of the accused at a time when Tiger resistance was collapsing in Sri Lanka.During the hearings, the accused spoke at length about the repression suffered in Sri Lanka and the atrocities committed by the security forces.

465,"Secretary General of the Tamil United Liberation Front, V. Anandasangaree, says that his party recommends probing of war crimes by both Domestic and Hybrid special courts in parts.Issuing a statement on Monday (21) Anandasangaree said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is very unfortunate that a matter of great importance to every one of us in this country and to many others from the diaspora, is being taken lightly. I am referring to the much awaited UNHRCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recommendations to probe the alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka.Without realizing the seriousness of the issue, all sorts of suggestionscome from all types of people, some of whom seem to be claiming that they are the authorities in this subject and some others expect that only a particular group should deal with this problem. Since many are pulling in deferent directions it is difficult to come to a common understanding. The UNHRC has recommended the setting up of a Hybrid special court to probe the alleged war crimes and has also advised the integration of international judges, prosecutors, Lawyers and investigators, while the U.S proposes the establishment of a domestic mechanism to inquire into the war crimes.As far as the Tamil United Liberation Front is concerned, in the first instance the TULF will opt to choose the Hybrid special court to probe the alleged war crimes. But after seriously considering the type of cases that are to be probed into, the TULF feels that in the interest of the victims certain types of crimes cannot be conveniently taken up by the Hybrid special courts and vice versa. Hence except some uncomplicated cases, all the others will have to be decided on the merits of each case, as to whether it is the Hybrid special court or the domestic mechanism that should probe into a particular incident, to determine which a special unit could be set up. Although I have very justifiable reasons for giving this suggestion, the TULF does not want to decide arbitrarily and instead wants the interested parties to take a joint decision. The practice of one taking a decision and the others following should be done away with and collective decision should be insisted on. It is a great shame for the Tamil Leadership not to get united even for matters that greatly concern their community.We have to learn from other ethnic groups.Let no one pretend to be cleverer than all the others.The most serious Human rights violations and crimes can be classified under three or four categories namely Rape with torture, Rape torture and murder, torture and murder, Missing persons accompanied with torture or murder etc. This can be further classified into offences committed by the forces and Paramilitary groups.Everyone knows that it is difficult or impossible to get a victim of rape and torture to give evidence in open court.Since most cases of rape will include torture as well,the TULF suggests setting up of panels comprised of female Judges or senior female Lawyers to hold inquiries in camera to the exclusion of others and make suitable recommendations including compensation.Cases of torture resulting in death should go to the Hybrid special court and only torture could be taken up for probing at the domestic courts.A committee could be setup to decide on the merits of each case as to which one should be investigated by the local court or the Hybrid special court.Cases for which capital punishment can be imposed should be referred to the Hybrid court and in the event of the Hybrid court is not setup, to appease the affected party, a team of observers with legal knowledge could be made present at all such trials. Furthermore in the event of absence of provisions in our laws to deal with a crime suitable provisions could be introduced in our legal system.

475,"A leaked secret document, which is said to belong to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on assessing Ã¢â‚¬Å“high-value targetingÃ¢â‚¬Â (HVT) programs world-wide for their impact on counterinsurgency, has reviewed the killing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.The document has been produced to review a chart for US officials to use in strategically assessing future operations and methods in HVT assassinations. The document has defined HTV as focused operations against specific individuals or networks whose removal or marginalization should disproportionately degrade an insurgent groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effectiveness.According to the secret document, life style stage of the LTTE has been described as a severely degraded one and noted that its (LTTE) future is uncertain after the conventional military defeat.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â€LTTE, 1983-May 2009 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) sought autonomy for the Tamils of northern and eastern Sri Lanka since the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inception in 1972. Velupillai Prabhakaran, a radical student, founded the group in response to the adoption of a new constitution institutionalizing Sinhalese domination, according to an academic study. The Sri Lankan Air Force, in November 2007 and January 2008, used antibunker bombs to target Prabhakaran and other top LTTE leaders, according to a clandestine source claiming firsthand access. Geocoordinate information provided by a former bodyguard of PrabhakaranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributed to an accurate Sri Lankan military bombing raid that killed LTTE political spokesman S.P. Tamilchelvan and other LTTE leaders on 2 November 2007, according to a clandestine source with whom a relationship was just beginning. The Sri Lankan Government claimed to have killed Prabhakaran and most of the LTTEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s senior leadership in conventional military operations in April and May 2009, according to a US military report and a Western press report.This is a secret CIA document assessing high-value targeting (HVT) programs world-wide for their impact on insurgencies. The document is classified SECRET//NOFORN (no foreign nationals) and is for internal use to review the positive and negative implications of targeted assassinations on these groups for the strength of the group post the attack. The document assesses attacks on insurgent groups by the United States and other countries within Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Iraq, Israel, Peru, Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, Libya, Pakistan and Thailand. The document, which is Ã¢â‚¬Å“pro-assassinationÃ¢â‚¬Â, was completed in July 2009 and coincides with the first year of the Obama administration and Leon PanettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s directorship of the CIA during which the United States very significantly increased its CIA assassination program at the expense of capture operations. It produces a chart for US officials to use in strategically assessing future operations and methods in HVT assassinations.The death or capture of key insurgents may lead to reduced domestic or foreign support for the group, as supporters recalculate the insurgent groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chances of winning the conflict and consider the potential costs of backing the losing side.

486,"                   The UN team, which has been put together to investigate allegations of human rights violations and war crimes against the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), will be holding hearings in New York, Geneva and Bangkok, UN sources told Express on Saturday.The team constituted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), would of course seek permission to hold sittings in Sri Lanka. But it is unlikely to get it as the Sri Lankan government has rejected any international probe.Sources said that Tamil expatriates and Lankan Tamil rights groups which are very active in North America, Europe and Australia, would testify at New York, Geneva and Bangkok. Tamils living in Lanka would be interacting through telephone, video conferencing and skype. Rights groups in Sri Lanka might organise such interactions besides travelling abroad to testify.There is no law in Sri Lanka to bar any citizen from testifying before a UN body, but government ministers have publicly warned that those bad mouthing Lanka at the UN inquiry would be dealt with. In the absence of a witness protection law, witnesses could be subjected to intimidation as has been the case in Sri Lanka so far. However, as the proceedings of the Lankan governments own Disappearances Commission show, witnesses could brave threats and testify fearlessly.To protect witnesses against intimidation by pro-government groups, the UN team might keep their identities secret for 20 years as the earlier Darusman panel on Sri Lanka did.But the Lankan government could challenge the veracity of the testimonies used by the UN team on the grounds that the identities of the witnesses are shrouded mystery, as indeed it did in the case of the stinging Darusman report earlier. To counter the UN investigation, the Sri Lankan government has started its own investigation into the charges of rights violations and war crimes by expanding the mandate of the existing Disappearances Commission. The UN and Lankan commissions would be working contemporaneously. But while the UN commission would not be able to get many Lankan Tamils resident in Lankas war affected areas to testify, most of those testifying before the Lankan panel would be living in the war affected parts of the island. The Lankan panels report is therefore likely to have greater credibility. This could provide Colombo with a good instrument to discredit the UN investigation.Asked if the foreign advisors to the Sri Lankan panel (Sir Desmond de Silva, Sir Geoffrey Nice, and Prof David Crane, could be counted upon to give government-friendly advice, a source said that the terms of appointment had clearly stated that they shall tender advice only when the panel seeks their advice. Also, President Rajapaksa has reserved the right to appoint more advisors.A news report pointed out on Saturday, that while the Lankan government has revealed the composition of its panel, the UN OHCHR has not revealed the composition of its panel fully. The latter has only revealed the name of the Coordinator and those of three experts or advisors. Thus, the Lankan government seems to be more transparent. Colombo might well ask how the UN panel could be taken seriously when its composition is shrouded in mystery.The UN panel will have very little time to do its work. lt will have to gather fresh evidence (from four different places in the world), write the report, send it to the Lankan government for its comments, and submit the final draft report by January so that it could be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2015. The Lankan panel, on the other hand, has a less cumbersome and time consuming procedure.

We cannot ignore IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence. We cannot ignore India,Ã¢â‚¬Â says Namal Rajapaksa in an exclusive interview to TNM.Months after his defeat to Maithripala Sirisena, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa reportedly told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was very open, Americans, the Norwegians, Europeans were openly working against me. And RAW (IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Research Analysis Wing). Both the US and India openly used their embassies to bring me down.Ã¢â‚¬Â Reuters, however, reported that the former President had claimed he was not aware of all the facts.Namal denies that his father made this statement but paints the same allegation with a broader brush, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is the popular belief in Sri Lanka that India and US worked against President Rajapaksa in the last elections. Majority still believe that. He (Mahinda) never mentioned that India is partly responsible. People know that India had a major role. It was the situation between the two countries at that time. I am talking about the statements and behaviour of certain diplomats in Sri Lanka.Ã¢â‚¬ÂIt was widely reported after the fall of the Rajapaksa government that a RAW official was instrumental in uniting rival political parties Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) Ã¢â‚¬â€ against him during the polls. The official allegedly helped gather support for Sirisena. He was reportedly transferred but the Indian Government had called it Ã¢â‚¬ËœroutineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.When pressed further for names, the 31-year-old parliamentarian says Ã¢â‚¬Å“We saw through the media that the Indian High Commissioner and ambassador were with Sirisena and certain media said they favour them. I am not saying they are responsible. But certain behaviours and statements might have affected (the elections), is what people believe.Ã¢â‚¬ÂWhy did India interfere?India has involved itself in the internal politics of the island nation before. The Congress Government had sent its troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 to broker peace between the government and the LTTE. This time around, however, it is reported that the Ã¢â‚¬ËœinfluenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ asserted was to counter another regional rival that has increasingly threatened the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stronghold in South Asia - China.Multiple factors are said to have been responsible for IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing discontent with the Rajapaksa government. The first was when India was stunned in 2014 when Chinese submarines docked in Sri Lanka on two separate occasions. India saw it as part of BeijingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstring of pearlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ strategy to secure a foothold in South Asia and fulfil its desire to gain increasing maritime access through the Indian Ocean.Namal, however, refutes that the Rajapaksa government was compromising on IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security interests.Ã¢â‚¬Å“During our governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tenure, my father was very clear that Sri Lankan soil will not be used against India or any other neighbour,Ã¢â‚¬Â he claims.But it was not just this blatant aggression that China was displaying, investments became another route for them to gain more control over Sri Lankan assets.During his rule, Rajapaksa got $8 billion in loans from China to build a road network and infrastructure in Hambantota district and the Colombo Port City which is an offshore city built on a manmade island.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We first offered the port and the southern highway to the Indian Government. But for three years, they did not deliver. So, what do you expect us to do as a government in power?Ã¢â‚¬Â asks Namal. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wait for another three years for a country to come develop it? We instead gave it to people who were ready to take on the projects. If ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic interests in Sri Lanka trouble India, then they should take up more projects too,Ã¢â‚¬Â he adds defensively.But while this challenge is logical at first glance, reports reveal that it was the presence of Rajapaksa himself that deterred other countries from agreeing to invest in Sri Lanka. He was seen as an international pariah due to the manner in which his government eradicated the threat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) a terrorist organisation against whom they had fought a 25-year-long civil war for a separate homeland for the Tamil people. The civilian casualties that it caused and the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refusal to acknowledge the human right violations they had committed became a matter of international debate.China and Pakistan are said to have supplied arms to Sri Lanka and provided support to fight the ethnic conflict.And now, since the RajapaksaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s move to accept ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loan, the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence has grown larger. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Of course, we brought them (China). We are not denying it. We are happy about it,Ã¢â‚¬Â admits Namal. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But it is the Sirisena government that sold the port to them for 99 years. Why did they do that?Ã¢â‚¬Â he asks.As it turns out when the Sri Lanka Freedom Party-United National Party alliance came to power, they initially did put the deals on hold. The transaction with the Chinese were allegedly perceived as symbols of corruption and misplaced development. However, ballooning debt as a result of its predecessorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decisions reportedly compelled it to renegotiate the Hambantota port deal by turning debt into equity and giving it on a 99-year-long lease.Namal however doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to take into account the debt his government caused as he alleges, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Government is compromising on Sri Lankan interests by giving away control of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resources to a Chinese company. If the Rajapaksa government comes to power we will renegotiate the port deal.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHas Sri Lanka betrayed India?Ã¢â‚¬Å“The government has not betrayed India or China through this port deal. They have betrayed Sri Lankans. They need to make sure Sri Lankans benefit from whatever they do be it in terms of local labour or the like. They failed to do that.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSo, will Sri Lanka go the Maldives way and end up in a debt trap with China?In February, the exiled former Maldivian President Mohammed Nasheed had warned the world that what China offers in the guise of development is in fact debt traps. Will Sri Lanka be trapped in a position where they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say no to China?Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is not a debt trap in Sri Lanka,Ã¢â‚¬Â argues Namal. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All investors will come negotiate for their benefit. But receiving end should negotiate for our benefit. Which our government is not willing to do. Terms and conditions should benefit Sri Lankans. The Sri Lankan government will not come to a position to not say no. It is about how we handle and negotiate them,Ã¢â‚¬Â he explains.He further claims that ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic interests will not gain military colours. But China is already casting its nets to gain more control over the Indian Ocean.Multiple reports suggest that China will be attempting to monitor Indian maritime activity in the name of academic interests.They claim they are stepping up the academic work on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, but India sees it as a threat. As per the statement by China, it is reportedly going to set up a radar station at Ruhuna University for oceanographic studies. India believes that ship tracking is going be part of this Ã¢â‚¬ËœstudiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Even Namal, who has been supporting the Chinese investment says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our government will not allow monitoring of Indian ships or compromise of their interests. Not sure how the current government will handle this geo politically.Ã¢â‚¬ÂBut ask about Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing relations with Pakistan which has been constantly accused of sponsoring terror in India and Namal says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We believe in non-alignment policy. We are being close to Pakistan in fighting terrorism. Pakistan has always been very close to Sri Lanka. We have close alliances with them.Ã¢â‚¬ÂWhat happened to the Tamils?Only a week ago, Sri Lanka lifted a state of national emergency it had imposed due to an outbreak of violence against Muslim communities. Hundreds of troops were deployed in the Kandy area and tear gas was used on groups which continued to defy government curfews.Namal, however, is not surprised by this. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a problem between two groups. Politicians got involved in it. Any country can have such isolated incidents. The current government is responsible because they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle the situation properly,Ã¢â‚¬Â he alleges.Ã¢â‚¬Å“When you use communal tensions during elections, it will boomerang on you,Ã¢â‚¬Â Namal adds.It was the first time in seven years that Sri Lanka had imposed a state of emergency. They were under the measure for nearly three decades when the government fought Tamil rebels in the civil war. And Namal Rajapaksa is no stranger to the violence and blamegame that ethnic conflicts can bring with it.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our government has been accused of human right violation and the death of civilians. But every media report and international organisation quotes a different death toll,Ã¢â‚¬Â argues Namal.Leaving numbers aside, can he deny that his government was responsible for the death of thousands of civilians and innocents? Even LTTEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deceased chief PrabhakaranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minor son was allegedly shot at close range by the army.Ã¢â‚¬Å“But we defeated terrorism and millions of Tamil and Sinhalese people are living peacefully,Ã¢â‚¬Â says Namal. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instead of Tamil youth having cyanide around their necks, they are going to school and to work. Tamils are taking care of their families and growing,Ã¢â‚¬Â he adds.Source: The News Minute-Agencies",OTHER,SINHALA,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=46592,21,,Sinhala,News

173,"The new Sri Lankan government has Ã¢â‚¬Å“a very strong intentÃ¢â‚¬Â in addressing human rights concerns, a top Obama Administration official said, calling for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“credible domesticÃ¢â‚¬Â probe with Ã¢â‚¬Å“substantial involvementÃ¢â‚¬Â from international community to address justice and accountability.Less than a month after she visited Sri Lanka ahead of a crucial report on alleged war crimes during the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long civil war with the LTTE, assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia Nisha Desai Biswal told PTI: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have seen (in the new government), what we would say a very strong intent.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“We have seen that the government in the past nine months in office has done more to try to build trust and move the country towards a more inclusive society, than perhaps been done in the last nine years and beyond,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Biswal, the administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point person for South and Central Asia.Ã¢â‚¬Å“That is an encouraging sign. It is a long road ahead for the country, for the government, for the (new Sri Lankan) president (Maithripala Sirisena) and for the people,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said in response to a question.Biswal said much needs to be done to heal the wounds that are still open on both sides from a very brutal and a very divisive conflict between the troops and the LTTE. Rights groups claim troops killed 40,000 civilians in the final months of the nearly three decades-long civil war that ended in 2009. The LTTE is also accused of war crimes.Ã¢â‚¬Å“That would take time and would take very persistent effort on all sides towards reconciliation and no one should be saying one about the process. It is a difficult process, it is a long process. There will inevitably be setbacks.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is fundamentally in the interest of the Sri Lankan people to secure the peace and prosperity of all of these citizens, and I think what motivates us is that hope and that desire to support a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka that brings opportunity for all its citizens,Ã¢â‚¬Â Biswal said.During her visit to Sri Lanka late last month, she said the US will move a pro-Sri Lanka resolution at the United Nations human rights council (UNHRC) in its September session, in what was seen as a U-turn in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stance.Interestingly, it was a US-moved resolution that for the first time called for an international probe into alleged war crimes and was adopted last year in the 47-member UNHRC. The US was at the forefront in adopting a total of three resolutions at the UN human rights session on Sri Lanka.Biswal on Friday said that from the very beginning, the US has said it would support a credible domestic effort to address those long-standing issues of justice and accountability in Sri Lanka.Source: PTI",OTHER,SINHALA,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=32398,12,,Sinhala,News

Jaishankar today in Phnom Penh to discuss the implications of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aggression against Ukraine and Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic and political situation.Excerpts of Comments by US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken And Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry Before Their Meeting:SECRETARY BLINKEN: Good afternoon, everyone. First I should say to you, Foreign Minister, congratulations on your appointment. We were very pleased to work with you in your previous capacity as a minister, but welcome this opportunity now.Obviously, Sri Lanka is in a moment of challenge and crisis; the United States has worked hard to step in to support Sri Lanka in this moment. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve provided about $179 million worth of assistance of one kind or another, including loans and direct support, since June. But in crisis there is also opportunity, and I hope that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and we hope and will certainly support Sri Lanka in these efforts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an opportunity in this moment to create a more inclusive, representative, democratic, responsive government and to use this crisis to seize that opportunity to make something very positive out of a very difficult situation. It would stand Sri Lanka in very, very good stead.WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also very supportive of Sri Lanka and the IMF working out an arrangement that also requires appropriate debt restructuring that has to be done on an equitable basis with all of the creditors doing whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s necessary to support Sri Lanka at this time.But I appreciate taking the time to meet today and look forward to having a conversation. Thank you.FOREIGN MINISTER SABRY: Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for your warm congratulatory messages when I took over. And I have worked very closely with your government in my previous capacity both as the finance minister and the justice minister, and we really appreciate the role played by the U.S. in trying to get an IMF bailout as soon as possible and the debt being restructured. We understand the challenges, and in this challenge we also understand there are opportunities. And one good thing about the whole thing is the Sri Lankans have been united in all this and largely they have been peaceful; there are no incidents. Basically the whole sort of revolution had taken place, but it had taken place very peacefully. So thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the good part of it.We see that there is a huge obligation on our part to put the country back on track and get its economy out of the woods, which we are going through right now, and we look forward to work with the American administration, U.S. administration throughout. And we are very thankful for all the support. In the recent past we have seen a very high-level delegation visiting Sri Lanka, and then we have had several roundtable discussions and we have had a lot of support for our IMF approach from the U.S. Treasury and State Department and from the government in general.So thankful Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thank you once again.

266,"                   The Australian federal police declined the opportunity to interview a Sri Lankan asylum seeker sent back from Christmas Island who alleged he had been severely tortured by local police on his return, a cable obtained under freedom of information laws has revealed.The cable, sent to Canberra from the Australian high commission in Colombo in August 2010, states that the AFP did not interview the alleged torture victim so as to avoid interference with an investigation being conducted by the Sri Lankan police.In the interests of keeping our distance from the Sri Lankan investigation, we do not intend to take up the offer to meet with him, the cable states.It states the man was arrested as a result of a disruption  or operation to combat suspected people smuggling  that had occurred a week previously. The detained suspect is a Sinhalese returnee from Christmas Island, it reads.The cable reveals that an AFP officer instead managed to sight the man while he was in Sri Lankan custody and deduced that he appears in good health but it is unclear how much time had elapsed between the alleged torture and the AFP viewing the returned asylum seeker. The case was eventually written off as unsubstantiated.The cable also makes reference to a letter from the returned asylum seekers lawyer, which lays out the torture allegations in detail. It makes clear that the high commission was in possession of this letter at the time the torture allegations were made.The legal letter, which formed part of the returned documents from a Freedom of Information Act request initiated by Guardian Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre, sheds further light on the allegations.It states that the alleged torture victim had received a call from the Australian high commission in Colombo seeking to return some of his possessions from Christmas Island, a year after his return. It says just a few days after this call, the man was contacted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Sri Lankan police.According to the letter, the man was later arrested and witnesses reported he was publicly tortured by CID in front of other villagers, mother and wife. The letter states that the man was tortured again in custody and that his lawyer had been prevented from visiting him.Usually Sri Lankan police do not allow victims to say that they were tortured. They somehow prevent this kind of things by threatens [sic]. We need doctors to inspect  immediately, the letter states.The cable from the high commission says the alleged torture victim would be seen by a doctor and that the CID officer in charge of the case had told the AFP the torture allegations had no basis. The cable also states that the initial arrest was conducted by the Sri Lankan navy.According to Amnesty international, torture in police custody is rampant in Sri Lanka, with the countrys national human rights commission recording 86 torture complaints in the first three months of 2013 alone.The case referred to in the cable is one of four brought to the Australian high commission in Colombo as of June 2013.In April 2013, the foreign minister at the time, Bob Carr referenced these four cases and said there was absolutely no evidence of an abuse of human rights on two of them  including the August 2010 case  following investigations by the high commission.Guardian Australia contacted Carr, who said he stood by these remarks and added he would not comment on the case where the AFP had declined to interview an alleged torture victim.Emily Howie, director of advocacy and research at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the August 2010 case showed that Australia was not fulfilling its non-refoulement obligations under the refugee convention.If this is how Australia investigates complaints of severe torture how can we accept government claims that Sri Lankan returnees are not at risk of harm? she said.This kind of monitoring of returnees is woefully inadequate considering the gravity of the complaints made. It is difficult to accept government assertions that Sri Lankans are not harmed on return if an Australian official fails to take the most basic step to look into allegations of extremely serious abuse.Sri Lankan asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat are subject to the enhanced screening process  a fast-track claim process, which has been condemned by the UN as unfair and unreliable.More than 1,000 Sri Lankan asylum seekers have been returned from Australia.Greens senator Lee Rhiannon said the case was an example of Australian officials ignoring evidence of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.Time again we have seen that Australian officials are prepared to disregard evidence of torture by Sri Lankan officials that have been exposed by human rights organisations and the media, because it suits their domestic policy, she said.This is a tragic response to very serious and continuing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka that are a result of Australias domestic immigration policy.A spokesman for the AFP confirmed that they had engaged local authorities with regards to the torture allegations. But added that despite being invited to interview the alleged victim and viewing him, Australian Government agencies, including the AFP, do not have the local authority to conduct any investigations in Sri Lanka. - The Guardian  ",OTHER,SINHALA,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=26042,40,,Sinhala,News

Asked why the British government has chosen to attend the CHOGM rather than boycott it as some have urged, he said British Prime Minister David Cameron has confirmed that he will attend the meet because of the importance we place in the Commonwealth, which he termed as an organization of shared values.Values of respect for democracy, development, human rights, justice and rule of law. Values which were enshrined in the recently adopted Commonwealth charter, to which all commonwealth member states have signed up, Mr Rankin said. He further pointed out that as UK Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has made clear the Britain would look to Sri Lanka as it would at any host of CHOGM to demonstrate its commitment to those values.Attendance at CHOGM will also be an opportunity for the British government to further urge Sri Lanka to make concrete progress in the areas of human rights, reconciliation and a political settlement, he said.

284,"Sri Lanka has a marvellous opportunity to heal andreconcile its twin populations after 25 years of civil war, says ChandrikaKumaratunga, Sri Lankas former prime minister and president. Which is why she is more than a little baffled at theslowness with which the Mahinda Rajapaksa government is building post-civil warbridges. Such opportunities do not last forever, she warned.That is why they are called windows and not something larger.In New Delhi for the first annual conference of her ownSouth Asia Policy and Research Institute (SAPRI), Kumaratunga said that sinceretired from active politics six years ago, she had dedicated herself to twointernational organisations, the Club of Madrid and the Clinton GlobalInitiative.Now I have created my own foundation, she says. SAPRI will look at issues regarding the subcontinent,Kumaratunga says, engaging research scholars globally on these topics. These deliberations will result in policyrecommendations which will be communicated to policy-makers and professionals.Sri Lanka is still fertile ground for the dissemination ofsuch ideas. While the civil war has seen some repair work accomplished,Kumaratunga says still more needs to be done in terms of physicalreconstruction and rehabilitation.Kumaratunga led Lanka during some of the bloodiest years ofthe civil war. Today, with a Tamil minority who want rights but of whom only asmall minority still talk of a homeland, she seems worried Colombo doesntrecognize what a good thing it has going for it.Rajapaksas abrogation of her promise of Tamil politicaldevolution  a decision he had been party to at the time and did not oppose was one reason Kumaratunga declined to support him in the last elections. Even though he called me eight times askingfor support, she remembers.Kumaratunga strongly denies she backed the rival candidate,General Sarath Fonseka. Normally I would have supported Rajapaksa: I am stillpatron and member of our party. But I could not support some of his policies.So she stayed out of the campaign altogether.If she is concerned at Rajapaksas minority policies, she isbewildered by his foreign policy. In my time, we practiced nonalignment,which meant keeping good relations with the entire world, she says. This ledmany Western countries to agree to ban or limit the activities of the TamilTigers. Kumaratunga is clearly discomfited with Rajapaksas confrontationalpolicies with the West and his rhetorical claims to having new friends inChina, Myanmar and Iran.Relations with India are essential and crucial, shestresses. Which leads her to wonder, after New Delhis recent United Nationsvote against Sri Lanka, what has changed there. Two years ago, in similarcircumstances, India actually canvassed on Lankas behalf. Somethings musthave changed, she says. I do not know what they are.Unsurprisingly, a key interest of SAPRI, besides developmentand poverty alleviation, is how such issues lead to conflict. Kumaratunga ismuch taken with Frances Stewarts work on horizontal inequalities and theirconnection to violence and conflict. The first priority is that all sectionsof a population must be brought into a development process, she says. That isthe theme of the conference. Hindustan Times reports.

296,"Sri Lankas presidentsaid Wednesday that rising labor costs in China present an opportunity forhis South Asian country to attract foreign companies seeking an alternativelow-cost manufacturing base. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in New York for the United Nations GeneralAssembly, told The Wall Street Journal that the once war-torn country hasenjoyed a 15-month period of peace during which his government has focused onrebuilding roadways and railroads in the ravaged North and East, expanding theavailability of electricity and clean water, and providing homes, among otherthings. He said Sri Lanka--with aliterate population, relatively low labor costs, and a sizeable corps oftrained accountants--is drawing the interest of outsourcing firms, includingmajor Indian business-process outsourcing companies seeking ways to expandoutside India,where wages also have been rising. In addition, European and U.S.retailers are increasingly turning to Sri Lankato produce apparel at costs below those in China, Mr. Rajapaksa added. Hiscountry faces a labor shortage in the apparel sector as a result of thisinterest, he added. Ashroff Omar, chief executive of apparel exporter Brandix Lanka Ltd., saidit currently costs about $150 a month to employ a trained Sri Lankan apparelworker, compared with $400 in China.In a couple of years, he said, the cost in Chinawill be about $600, compared with around $200 in Sri Lanka. Mr. Omar and about two dozen business leaders and government ministersaccompanied President Rajapaksa to the U.S. Tourism is growing in his country, as Indian travelers gravitate to apeaceful Sri Lanka,and interest among European tourists--particularly Scandinavians--picks up, Mr.Rajapaksa said. Agriculture and fisheries are also key drivers of economicgrowth. President Rajapaksa acknowledged that Sri Lanka still suffers from alingering perception that it remains a war zone, but said there have been noincidents for more than a year and foreign governments have generally removedadvisories warning travelers to stay away. The countrys economy grew 8.5% in the second quarter, compared with 7.1%year-on-year growth in the first quarter, according to Fitch Ratings.Inflation, at just under 6%, is under control, Sri Lankas president said. TheInternational Monetary Fund recently said a Central Bank of Sri Lanka rate cut was appropriatepolicy and projected a continuation of single-digit inflation for the year.

In fact, what is set out is seen as a litany of generalities, marked for being vague and unauthenticated.His Excellency the President wants you to be assured that there is absolutely no surveillance of your telephone and eÃ¢â‚¬Âmail communications, and of your residences in Colombo and Horagolla.It is seen that the one item on which there is some element of the time of occurrence in your letter, is about your written complaint to the former Inspector General of Police, Mr. Jayantha Wickremeratne, by your said letter of 10th October 2009, with regard to Visits said to have been paid to several of your friends by officers who introduced themselves as being from the NIB. It is seen that what you have stated causes genuine doubt whether they were in fact officers or were from the NIB (at all). You would agree that it is now several years after this complaint. Therefore, His Excellency the President is surprised that as a former Minister of Defence who had control over the Police Department, you did not bother to inform him at that time of this inadequate response of the IGP, to enable an inquiry to have been held.With regard to the statements you have made about NIB officers visiting and interrogating the management of hotels you have visited, reporting on who attends such meetings with you, and the alleged fear among hotel managements to the point of your being unable to arrange personal events at hotels, His Excellency the President is of the view that they are not supported by any evidence of time, place or persons. This is the same with your statements about the alleged harassment of your long time friends in the Kurunegala District who you say have cause for similar fears, and the hotel at Anuradhapura where you were with foreign friends. His Excellency the President further notes that none of these accusations stands the test of authenticity for lack of evidence regarding both persons and places, as well as date and time. H.E the President regrets that the absence of such necessary details to substantiate the allegations you make, gives the impression that these are more imaginary than actual, raising concerns about the seriousness of your complaints.Excellency, you state of a situation of severe emotional and mental stress to you due to the alleged intimidation of your friends and associates that is compounded by the knowledge you claim to have of senior members of our Party and our Government being asked by H.E the President to desist from talking or associating with you, during the past 8 years of his Presidency. Here too, it is the view of His Excellency that it would have been greatly helpful to establish the veracity of your claim, if even one such person had been named.His Excellency is most surprised by your reference to the context of a culture of white vans, as he is of the view that you should know better that such a culture arose before your presidency, and continued during your entire presidency. Today, just as this Government has defeated the terrorism that caused so much violence and bloodshed, the white vans too are not any part of the political culture of this country; except in the minds of those who are keen to tarnish the image of this country abroad to suit the agenda of forces abroad that are ranged against this country.His Excellency emphatically and wholly rejects your reference to a prevailing practice of destroying anyone who is considered a threat to the higher authorities of your Government, by murder, disappearances physical attacks, leading to serious reasons to be concerned about your safety. He sees this as a statement of complete untruth, which is proven by the large number of very prominent persons who are strongly opposed to and openly critical of this Government and those holding the higher offices in Government today. His Excellency notes that political and other social leaders who oppose the policies of this Government are clearly seen to be active today, in the peace and freedom that has been achieved. The allegations that you make in this regard are again seen as being of the same nature as the charges made, both here and abroad, by those who do not wish to see the strengthening of peace and achievement of reconciliation.

As the Executive President of Sri Lanka, he sees it as his bounden duty to ensure these freedoms to all citizens, and a former Executive President of the country is not excluded in ensuring this reach of Fundamental Freedoms.With your references to the soÃ¢â‚¬Âcalled activities of the NIB, which he sees as baseless as stated earlier, His Excellency also sees it necessary to remind you how members of your own Presidential Security Division were involved in serious crimes during your term in office. His Excellency is glad there are no such instances to point out today.Also, Excellency, with regard to surveillance you have complained so much about, His Excellency considers it necessary to remind you that although as a former President of the country, you do have an official security detail, it remains the duty of the Police Service to ensure your safety at public places.

359,"A senior U.S. Treasury official on Monday said there were signs of Ã¢â‚¬Å“potential improvementÃ¢â‚¬Â in sovereign debt restructuring cases and more vulnerable countries were expected to seek help, but further work was needed to accelerate the process.Treasury Assistant Secretary for International Finance Brent Neiman noted advances in the cases of Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka over the past year, along with development of new technical approaches, adding his hope that Ghana would reach agreement on its external restructuring in the coming weeks.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We clearly havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gone far enough or fast enough and much more work remains,Ã¢â‚¬Â Neiman said in a speech at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The critical test of any progress will be whether it is sustained when, as seems likely, more countries come forward requesting debt treatments,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“But, I am hopeful that our recent efforts are yielding some movement toward an improved international debt architecture that can help low- and middle-income countries when they need it.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe gave no details on which countries might be ready to ask for help as long-stalled debt restructuring processes moved forward for Zambia, Ghana and others.The Group of 20 major economies set up the Common Framework for debt relief for low-income countries during the COVID pandemic, but only two cases - Chad and Zambia - have completed the process, with EthiopiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request still in work.The glacial pace of progress on debt restructuring dampened interest among other countries, despite the fact that a majority of low-income countries are in or near debt distress.Neiman said the focus that global leaders put on the issue had helped to elevate this topic toward the top of the international economic agenda. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) has brought together borrowers, official and private sector lenders and international institutions to help agree on common terms and treatments.Roundtable participants have discussed state-contingent debt instruments (SCDIs) which helped advance ZambiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s restructuring and Neiman said these can be helpful when creditors disagree on a borrowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future prospects, such as differences in the outlook for oil prices for an oil exporting debtor country.These securities are designed to pay more interest when growth is higher or prices of key commodities increase, or they can reduce interest payments if there is an extreme weather event or other natural disaster.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since SCDIs can automatically lower debt repayments in times of economic stress, the hope is that they can reduce the need for debt treatments in the first place,Ã¢â‚¬Â Neiman said.Restructuring domestic debt also can help smooth the process for external debt restructuring efforts, as in the case of Ghana, Neiman said. But a simple insistence for comparable treatment between domestic and external debt - with the same reduction in net present value - could impose particularly large economic costs for domestic debt holders, including banks in the debtor country holding the debt, and is not always workable.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We hope that a simple insistence on achieving comparability of treatment between domestic and external debt will not in the future hold up any restructuring cases,Ã¢â‚¬Â Neiman said.(Reuters)--Agencies",OTHER,SINHALA,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=94305,2,,Sinhala,News
365,"The efforts to increase tax revenues should be pursued in a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgrowth-friendlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ manner while protecting the poor and vulnerable people, says Peter Breuer, the IMF Asia & Pacific DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka.His remarks came during a special virtual press briefing held this morning (March 21) on the IMF-supported 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka.The executive board of the International Monetary Fund green-lighted this extended arrangement on Monday (March 20). Breuer said the IMF executive boardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approval marks an important step towards the resolution of this crisis.The EFF program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations.Now that the IMFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s board approval is received, Sri Lanka will immediately receive an initial disbursement of USD 333 million (amounting to SDR 254 million) from the EFF arrangement, which is expected to catalyze new external financing including from the ADB and the World Bank, Breuer said further.He assured that the first tranche of the loan would be released in the next couple of days, emphasizing that the disbursements will be subjected to reviews every 6 months.The Senior Mission Chief underscored that the tax reforms implemented under the EFF program are designed to be progressive, meaning that it ensures greater contributions are made by high income earners.He also emphasized that the economic impact of the reforms on the poor and vulnerable needs to be mitigated with appropriate measures.Attributing the island nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s severe crisis to the past policy missteps and economic shocks, Breuer commended the Sri Lankan authorities for implementing challenging policy actions to ride out the crisis situation.He said it is now essential to continue the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœreform momentumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ under strong ownership by the authorities and the Sri Lankan people more broadly.The Senior Mission Chief explained that the reform program supported under the EFF arrangement is built on strong policy measures and prioritizes the following five key pillars:Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ An ambitious revenue-based fiscal consolidation, accompanied by stronger social safety nets, fiscal institutional reforms, cost recovery-based energy pricing to ensure the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to support all its essential expendituresÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Restoration of public debt sustainability including through debt restructuring to ensure stable financing of the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A multi-pronged strategy restore price stability and rebuild reserves under greater exchange rate flexibility in order to alleviate the burden of inflation, particularly on the poor, to foster an environment of investment and growth and to assure Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to purchase essential goods from abroadÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Policies to safeguard the financial sectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stability to ensure that the financial sector can play its key role in supporting economic growthÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Structural reforms to address corruption, and vulnerabilities and enhance growthHighlighting the importance of anticorruption and governance reforms, Breuer said it is indispensable to ensure that people receive the benefits of the hard-won gains from reforms.Breuer further stressed that Sri Lanka must present a debt restructuring strategy by the end of April 2023 to reach the IMF targets to achieve debt sustainability.Meanwhile, IMFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Masahiro Nozaki, with regard to Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local government (LG) polls repeatedly postponed due to the economic crisis situation, clarified that the IMF does not intervene in the election process.

The 2022 forecast has been revised downward by 1.0 percentage point compared to the January projection, mostly due to the impacts of the war in Ukraine.Countries in South Asia are already grappling with rising commodity prices, supply bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities in financial sectors. The war in Ukraine will amplify these challenges, further contributing to inflation and deteriorating current account balances.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The World Bank is deeply concerned about the uncertain economic outlook in Sri Lanka and the impact on people,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Faris Hadad-Zervos, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are working on providing emergency support for poor and vulnerable households to help them weather the economic crisis and we remain committed to the wellbeing of the people of Sri Lanka, and to a narrative of sustainable and inclusive growth that will require concerted and collective actionÃ¢â‚¬ÂSri Lanka needs to address the structural sources of its vulnerabilities. This would require reducing fiscal deficits especially through strengthening domestic revenue mobilization. Sri Lanka also needs to find feasible options to restore debt sustainability. The financial sector needs to be carefully monitored amid high exposure to the public sector and the impact of the recent currency depreciation on banksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ balance sheets. The necessary adjustments may adversely affect growth and impact poverty initially but will correct the significant imbalances, subsequently providing the foundation for stronger and sustainable growth and access to international financial markets. Mitigating the impacts on the poor and vulnerable would remain critical.In South Asia, though GDP growth continues to be solid during the recovery, all countries in the region will face challenges ahead. On a positive note, exports of services from the region are on the rise as the pandemic subsides.The war and its impact on fuel prices can provide the region with much-needed impetus to reduce reliance on fuel imports and transition to a green, resilient and inclusive growth trajectory. The report recommends that countries steer away from inefficient fuel subsidies that tend to benefit wealthier households and deplete public resources. South Asian countries plan to move towards a greener economy by gradually introducing taxation that puts tariffs on products which cause environmental damage.Another challenge the region faces is the disproportionate economic impact the pandemic has had on women.

The bank issued a corrected number of $7.5 billion as of the first quarter. When asked about the official figure, Wickremesinghe put it at $14.2 billion, though the time period was unclear. The higher number could also be due to officials using a broader measure of external debt.Sri Lanka, bailed out by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 and mid-2016, should not need further support from the global lender, the prime minister said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have been going to the IMF a bit too often ...

And progress on other crucial development, like the airport expansion, has been slow, it said.Businesses were hurt by the imposition of a one-off super gains tax, banking and telco levies, sugar taxes and other ad-hoc revenue raising measures. In addition, investigations by the newly-established Financial Crimes Investigation Division have also weighed on sentiment, the article said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sri Lanka remains vulnerable to shocks with its high public debt, large financing needs and weak external position. These weaknesses are reflected in a sovereign credit rating of B+ by S&P and Fitch. And there appears to be a strong sense onshore that neither the coalition government nor its leaders individually will survive the next general elections due in 2020,Ã¢â‚¬Â the report said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Understandably, global investors are wary of investing in a market marred by scandal, political uncertainty and a slowdown in growth. But Sri Lanka has made progress on important reforms and regardless of how the political leadership transitions there will remain a focus on infrastructure development.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe article said that the International Monetary Fund programme has been successful, with notable improvements made on tax and fuel price reforms, and a rebuilding in forex reserves. Road connectivity is improving and some of the significant real estate development around Colombo is nearing completion, as is the land reclamation required for the Port City project. Real GDP growth 1 may rebound to 4.6% this year from 3.1% in 2017, with inflation around 5% through 2018.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tourism numbers have quadrupled over the past decade to 2.1 million in 2017, but this has put pressure on the transportation infrastructure, with the airport running at double its capacity. In addition, the Port of Colombo will hit full capacity in the next few years.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe article states that there hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been any development of specialised industrial zones since 2002, so progress will have to be made on the plans to develop five locations that have been identified. Parts of the Port City project, mainly the planned International Financial Centre, could be up and running by 2023.Free trade agreements with China, India and Singapore are either already in place or will be concluded relatively soon. To better facilitate trade, the government is working with the World Bank to develop the infrastructure that will provide a single portal detailing all procedures relevant to import/export, and a National Single Window to provide a single transaction point between the trade community, private sector and government.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hence, with some reasonably good execution, Sri Lanka could see itself playing a greater role in areas such as tourism, logistics and services, and as a financial centre in the years ahead.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Therefore even taking into account the political backdrop and election risks in 2020, we remain positive on the longer term outlook for Sri Lanka, supported by improvements in policy coordination, infrastructure development and strategic geographic advantages.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe report said that compared with some of the other frontier and even core bond markets in Asia, Sri Lanka has a relatively liquid market. Foreign ownership is low having been around only 5% as it is an off-benchmark trade for most investors and one that requires a significant amount of due diligence.The local currency market is primarily domestically driven, which gives it a lower correlation and some resilience in the face of some of the external shocks that have hit broader emerging markets, it said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“At the levels the market has traded at in recent years, an investor has more than adequately been paid to take risk.

This could lead to people losing faith in the Central Bank,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told reporters in Colombo.He stated that the Governor of the Central Bank should temporarily resign before the investigation is launched and that it is the only way to ensure transparency.Handunnetti said that because it has been revealed that the company Ã¢â‚¬ËœPerpetual TreasuriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is connected to the son-in-law of the Central Bank Governor, he can resume duties or resign according to the conclusion of the probe.The money markets were in an uproar on Friday, February 27 when the CB announced it was accepting bids worth Rs. 10 billion at 9.50-12.50 per cent whereas clients and most primary dealers had made bids between 9.50 and 10.50 per cent, not in the 11-12 per cent range.

Sri Lankan police earlier this month sought red notices, effectively an international arrest warrant, for 40 members of the LTTE, including for Sivaparan. Sri Lankan authorities sped up the hunt for Nediyavan and Vinayagam, another LTTE faction leader based in Europe, after three key operatives of the banned outfit were killed in a major operation last week and were believed to be attempting a revival of the LTTE.  Nediyavan and Vinayagam, who was already listed by the Interpol, had reportedly directed the action locally of three LTTE operatives - Gopi, Appan and Theviyan - who were killed in a shootout with the military. Theviyan, a former LTTE member, had returned to Sri Lanka from a foreign country, officials said. Funds for regrouping of the LTTE had come to Sri Lanka through illegal money transferring systems. These monies had been used to procure safe houses and vehicles to revive the LTTE locally, officials said. Last month, Sri Lanka gazetted the names of over 400 individuals who are said to be LTTE activists and contributors to the LTTE finances.The Sri Lankan government had also sent out an alert demanding that Norways government arrest Perinpanayagam Sivaparan, who is based in Oslo, claiming that he is the new leader of the LTTE.Morten HÃƒÂ¸glund, the incoming State Secretary in Norways Foreign Ministry, told state broadcaster NRK that the foreign ministry was still evaluating how to respond to the approach. Norway had briefly arrested Sivaparan in Oslo in 2011, interviewing him over his role in financing operations for the LTTE among the Tamil diaspora in the Netherlands and then releasing him on conditional bail. But while the five Dutch Tamils were in October 2011 jailed for six months by a court in The Hague for raising money for an organisation on the European Unions banned list, Sivaparan has not been called back by Norwegian police.

4,"Former President Maithripala Sirisena was accused of attempting to shift blame, as well as key decision-making responsibilities, to save himself, and for his selective memory of events in the days leading up to the Easter attacks.He cross-examined by attorneys representing former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, and former IGP Pujith Jayasundara at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.During the cross-examination, the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Counsel Anura Meddegoda, representing former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, questioned the former President about why he chose to arrive back in the country on his originally planned flight when there were 03 earlier flights available.The former President replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“As a President, I do not know flight times and schedules. I only stick to the times given to me by my officials and I simply turn up as expected.The other issue was that my physician in Singapore had just administered an injection to me, and advised me not to fly for a 24-hour period. Despite this, I risked my own health and arrived back at midnight.Ã¢â‚¬ÂFollowing this, the cross-examination continued, this time led by the legal representative for the former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, Attorney-at-Law Dilshan Jayasuriya.The Attorney first asked the witness Ã¢â‚¬Å“Did you visit the Tirupati Temple in India, on the 16th of April, before flying to Singapore?Ã¢â‚¬Â In response, the former President replied that this was an annual pilgrimage.The Attorney then stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Tirupati pilgrimage is a very difficult one due to the thousands of pilgrims. With you having being in too much of discomfort to take calls on the 20th and 21st of April, were you able to complete the Tirupati pilgrimage?Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe former President replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“With the blessings of the Triple Gem and the gods, I was not in discomfort at that time.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe Attorney then asked him, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Were you accompanied by on the 16th by your spouse and the three children?Ã¢â‚¬Â The former Head of State responded saying that recall if all three of his children went with him at the time.To this, the attorney stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is not a joke. The countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s President was on a personal jaunt, at a time the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national security was being threatened. Are you expecting me to accept that you, who recalled that IGP Pujith Jayasundara boarding the flight and saluting you on that day, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recall which of your own children accompanied you?Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe former President replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I honestly canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember.Ã¢â‚¬ÂFollowing this exchange on November 24, Attorney Dilshan Jayasuriya, recommenced his cross-examination when proceeding resumed yesterday (25).He began by saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would like to suggest to you that incidents such as the Mawanella Buddha statue vandalism, and the killing of police personnel in Vavunathivu, happened due to the confusion created in the country by the constitutional crisis you created in October 2018.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe former President replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I do not accept that. That wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a decision I took on my own. There were PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Counsels, academics, and many others who were involved in drafting gazettes.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe attorney then asked him, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Are you now trying to shift the responsibility for decision making to someone else?Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“No. To this day, I still believe that my decision was the right one.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe former President was then asked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You held a DIGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meeting on April 08, 2019. When SIS Chief Nilantha Jayawardena came for that meeting, he was already in possession of the Indian intelligence warning which he received on April 04. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t his failure to inform you of this warning at that time, a serious dereliction of duty?Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe responded, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t call that a dereliction of duty. I am reluctant to blame just one person for not preventing the attacks and for not informing me.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThen-Attorney then asked the witness, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If that is the case, then isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the imprisonment of former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and former IGP Pujith Jayasundara unfair?Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe former President responded, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes, it could be.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe attorney then asked him, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you believed it to be unfair, then why did you say that they must be held responsible for this even before the Malagoda Commission report was released?Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe ex-President stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I only stated as such based on what was discussed at the National Security Council meetings.Ã¢â‚¬ÂTo this, the attorney stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am of the opinion that the reason you do not blame the former Director of State Intelligence for this incident, is because he did inform you of the warning the day before you went abroad, as well as the day before, and on the day of the attacks. Further, I reiterate that you are trying to absolve yourself of responsibility for this incident by not holding him accountable.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe former President said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I completely reject that allegation. If I knew of the warning I would have never left the country without making necessary arrangements.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe ex-President was then asked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If an investigation into this proves that you had in fact known of this and failed to take action, would it be only fair for action to be taken against you?Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“No, it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be unfair if that is proven.Ã¢â‚¬Â",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=69459,2,,Other Ethnic groups,News
5,"MP Namal Rajapaksa says that Sri Lanka is lacking in a second generation of Tamil politicians and that he believes political parties giving opportunities for young Tamil leaders to come up the ranks and get involved in the decision-making would help the reconciliation process.In the process of reconciliation and bringing harmony, what we needed is powerful Tamil politicians, he said in an interview with The Indian Express.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unfortunately, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a second generation of Tamil politiciansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Efficient and educated Tamil leaders were assassinated by LTTE.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“For a long-term political solution and representation, I feel political parties should give an opportunity to young Tamil leaders to come up, an opportunity to be in the limelight, get them media exposure and a role in decision-making for the country.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“By doing that, reconciliation will happen. If you keep on believing in regional political interests, your interests will be regional, so the solution too. So we need to have national leaders from Tamils,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.Expressing his views on India, the Hambantota District UPFA Parliamentarian said that the neighboring country has had a global presence under the rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last four or five years.Ã¢â‚¬Å“But there is criticism as well against the Modi government in Sri Lanka. Many feel that the current Sri Lankan President is adopting many policies of PM Modi.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is widespread criticism that the Sri Lankan PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach in issues such as corruption and the way he deals with Opposition leaders is similar to that of Modiji,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.Excerpts of the interview with The Indian Express:You are seen as the next-generation politician from the family. How do you foresee your political future?It depends on my destiny. Because modern-day politics doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work on a dynastic backgroundÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Dynasties are part of Asian culture, but at the end of the day, what matters most is who is going to get into leadership.Existence in politics is all about how you behave, how you work, how you spend time with people in your constituencyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I will definitely continue in politics and see where it takes me.There has been conflict between minority communities and the majority Sinhalese Buddhist communities. How do you view this communal face of Sri Lanka?Extremism is everywhere, not only with Islamic or Buddhist groups. It is about how the government tackles them. For example, if the government believes that Islamic radical groups are getting stronger and take the side of Buddhist groups, or they antagonise Buddhist groups by siding with Islamic groups, it will not be able to play the role of a government. A government should be ideally impartial, it shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t follow radical or extreme elements. That is the only way to sort out communal problems.How deep is your Sinhalese identity?Everyone believes in what they believe in. Protecting your own belief and culture is not extremism. I believe that it is always good to have a culture and belief in something. It is very important to take that forward to our next generation.Have you ever thought about looking at the reconciliation process of Tamils after the war, if they are being treated equally?Reconciliation will take more time; wounds will not be healed overnight. It was never a war between the Sinhalese army and Tamils but between the Sri Lanka government and a terrorist organisation. In the process of reconciliation and bringing harmony, what we needed is powerful Tamil politicians. Unfortunately, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a second generation of Tamil politiciansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Efficient and educated Tamil leaders were assassinated by LTTEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ For a long-term political solution and representation, I feel political parties should give an opportunity to young Tamil leaders to come up, an opportunity to be in the limelight, get them media exposure and a role in decision-making for the country. By doing that, reconciliation will happen. If you keep on believing in regional political interests, your interests will be regional, so the solution too. So we need to have national leaders from Tamils.How do you look at relationships with India, China and Pakistan?Sri Lanka always considers its priorities first. My fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s priority was ending the war, we worked with India, Pakistan, China, US and Israel for our goals. Our primary interest is development. So we invited Indian private sector companies to come here. When you see the huge Shangri-La hotel on the Colombo seafront, two huge structures being built next to Shangri-La are Indian investments. Whatever be the political interpretations surrounding the Indian Ocean region, I feel Sri Lanka should maintain a neutral position. While India was always like family in spite of misunderstanding or miscommunication, our China relations were based on religion, culture and commercial transactions dating back to the Silk Route.How close are you with your counterparts in other dynasties in neighbouring countries?I am in touch with most regional parties and dynastic families. Even if we have to keep our countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interests first, I have friendships with almost all of them. For instance, I speak to Rahul Gandhi. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari [Pakistan] and Sajeed Wazed [Bangladesh] are all my friends. Our families too interact often. When Rahul got elected president of the Congress, I called him personally to congratulate. Bilawal too is very close to me, whenever I go there, I stay at his house. Wazed was based in Washington DC earlier and now he is back in Bangladesh. I am not in touch with the Saudi prince [Mohammed bin Salman] but I am closely watching that young leader. I am sure he will look at his own culture and traditions to protect it while going into new avenues. Because 1.1 million Sri Lankans are in the Middle East, I am closely watching all developments in Middle Eastern countries.The Qatar emir [Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani] is also young while Dubai has a young family coming up. It is very interesting to see this new generation of western-educated, Middle East leaders and how they are governing in traditional Arabic culture.Your view India, its politics and foreign relationships?Domestic politics is up to them. But in the last four or five years, India has had a global presence under the rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Now, Rahul is also making the same presence with his trips to the Middle East, Malaysia and Singapore. But there is criticism as well against the Modi government in Sri Lanka. Many feel that the current Sri Lankan President is adopting many policies of PM Modi. There is widespread criticism that the Sri Lankan PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach in issues such as corruption and the way he deals with Opposition leaders is similar to that of Modiji. But in a larger way, I strongly believe that Sri Lanka can play a major role, we can be a communicating point between India and Pakistan, whenever they want a dialogue.Can you describe how you, as a teenager, perceived the war?Mostly it is men who start the war, and women and children die. People who start the war often forget the purpose at one point. So the war that was led by my father against LTTE was all about calculated damage, collateral damage. No war in the world has been won without damage. If you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fight the war, what would have been the damage? The world would have called Mahinda a good man but because he finished the war, our women are able to lead a dignified life without being abducted by LTTE to fight for them; our children are now going to the school instead of taking up arms.The war did have effects on my personal life as my mobility was restricted as the son of the President. But that was the time I played rugby in college. At one point, I had to change from Cardiff University in London to another following an attack and major security threats. But I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe that there was a Tamil diaspora but only an isolated LTTE diaspora who created trouble abroad. Even protesters before the London High Commission had been speaking Indian Tamil, not Jaffna Tamil. If these Tamil diaspora are so worried about Sri Lankan Tamils, they should come and help Tamils here.-Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=46580,59,,Other Ethnic groups,News

7,"Seattle became the first U.S. city to outlaw caste discrimination on Tuesday, after its local council voted to add caste to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anti-discrimination laws.The move addresses an issue important to the areaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s South Asian diaspora, particularly the Indian and Hindu communities. IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caste system is among the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest forms of rigid social stratification.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The fight against caste discrimination is deeply connected to the fight against all forms of oppression,Ã¢â‚¬Â Kshama Sawant, an Indian American Seattle City Council member, said.The caste system dates back thousands of years and allows many privileges to upper castes but represses lower castes. The Dalit community is on the lowest rung of the Indian Hindu caste system and have been treated as Ã¢â‚¬Å“untouchables.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“Caste discrimination doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only take place in other countries. It is faced by South Asian American and other immigrant working people in their workplaces, including in the tech sector, in Seattle and in cities around the country,Ã¢â‚¬Â Sawant said when her office introduced the proposal to ban caste-based discrimination in Seattle.Caste discrimination was outlawed in India over 70 years ago, yet bias persists, according to several studies in recent years, including one that found people from lower castes were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs.Even though India has banned untouchability, Dalits still face widespread abuse across that country, where their attempts at upward social mobility have at times been violently put down.Debate over the caste systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hierarchy is contentious in India and abroad, with the issue intertwined with religion. Some people say discrimination is now rare. Indian government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years.Activists opposing caste discrimination say it is no different from other forms of discrimination like racism and hence should be outlawed.

The laws that prevent that from happening must be repealed and protections that help uphold the rights of LGBTI people should be put in place without delay,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Rehab Mahamoor.Ã¢â‚¬Å“In 1883, the British who had taken control of the island of Sri Lanka, passed the Penal Code, the main law which defines what is a crime in Sri Lanka. Section 365 and 365A prohibited Ã¢â‚¬Å“carnal intercourse against the order of natureÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“gross indecencyÃ¢â‚¬Â. The Penal Code did not give a specific explanation of what these meant, but these vague and overly broad 136-year-old colonial laws are still being used to target LGBTI people in Sri Lanka todayÃ¢â‚¬Â, said Amnesty International in a statement.Artists Gimhani Galagedera, Madhri Samaranayake, Shenuka Corea and Akiel Surajdeen collaborated with Amnesty International to create Spectrum.BackgroundIn addition to Sections 365 and 365 A, Section 399 of the Penal Code bans Ã¢â‚¬Å“cheating by impersonationÃ¢â‚¬Â which means pretending to be someone else or telling a person they are someone that they are not. This law has been used frequently against transgender people, to allege that they are Ã¢â‚¬Å“pretendingÃ¢â‚¬Â to be a different gender.Another regulation, the Vagrants Ordinance, a 178-year-old law has been used to disproportionately target LGBTI people, allowing the police to take them into custody and even put them in prison to extort or harass them.The Sri Lankan Constitution protects the Fundamental Right to Equality (Article 12). At the 2014 International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights review, Sri Lanka confirmed that Article 12 prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, this right is rarely protected in the case of LGBTI individuals and they continue to be harassed, marginalized and abused on the basis of their real or perceived gender identity and/or sexual orientation.During its third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review carried out in November 2017, Sri Lanka stated that the country Ã¢â‚¬Å“is in the process of taking measures to guarantee the right to non-discrimination, inter alia, on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identityÃ¢â‚¬Â. It particularly focused on the commitment to reform the Penal Code. To date, however, there have been no steps taken towards reform.",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=59512,47,,Other Ethnic groups,News

24,"Transgender people and others who do not conform to social expectations about gender face discrimination and abuse in Sri Lanka, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.The 63-page report, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Five Fingers Are Not the SameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢: Discrimination on Grounds of Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation in Sri Lanka,Ã¢â‚¬Â finds that people who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t conform to gender norms face arbitrary detention, mistreatment, and discrimination accessing employment, housing, and health care. The government should protect the rights of transgender people and others who face similar discrimination, Human Rights Watch said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Sri Lankans, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, should be able to exercise their rights without discrimination or abuse,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Yuvraj Joshi, Gruber fellow in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights program at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. Ã¢â‚¬Å“While the government has begun to address these issues, it should urgently seek to eliminate laws and practices that discriminate on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHuman Rights Watch interviewed 61 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people in four Sri Lankan cities. Sixteen of those interviewed, most of them transgender or men who have sex with men, said they had suffered sexual or physical abuse by the police. More than half of this group said that police had detained them without cause at least once.Consensual same-sex conduct is criminalized under sections 365 and 365A of the penal code. Other laws, including a vaguely worded Vagrancy Law and a law against Ã¢â‚¬Å“cheating by personation,Ã¢â‚¬Â are also used to target gender non-conforming and other LGBTI people for arrest. Some transgender women and men who have sex with men said that repeated harassment by police, including arbitrary detention and mistreatment, had eroded their trust in Sri Lankan authorities, and made it unlikely that they would report a crime.Ã¢â‚¬Å“They wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t protect someone like me,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fathima,Ã¢â‚¬Â a 25-year-old transgender woman in Colombo who did not involve the police after thugs beat her in 2012.Transgender people also face discrimination in getting health care, including being labeled mentally ill; extra inquisitiveness and lack of privacy from medical staff; and unwillingness by some medical staff to tend to them.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Their words are more piercing than needles,Ã¢â‚¬Â one transgender man said of staff at public hospitals and clinics who asked unnecessary personal questions.These abuses take place within a broader legal landscape that fails to recognize the gender identity of transgender people without abusive requirements; makes same-sex relations between consenting adults a criminal offense; and enables a range of abuses against LGBTI people by state officials and private individuals.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The LGBTI community needs laws that protect us, not harm us,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, a Sri Lankan activist and founder of Equal Ground, a Colombo-based group that advocates for the rights of LGBTI Sri Lankans. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We expect the new government to scrap discriminatory laws and protect our human rights. We urge the government to be in open dialogue with us.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSri Lankan law currently provides no clear path to changing legal gender, Human Rights Watch said. Transgender people are rarely able to obtain a national identity card and other official documents that reflect their preferred name and gender, exposing them to constant and humiliating scrutiny. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Krishan,Ã¢â‚¬Â a 40-year-old transgender man in Colombo, said that the first question in job interviews is about his gender, not his qualifications.The Health Ministry, working with the National Human Rights Commission, has proposed a procedure through which transgender people could change the gender on their documents after a diagnosis from a mental health professional. While that would be a step forward, the authorities should allow people to change their legal gender on all documents without requiring psychiatric diagnosis or medical treatment or procedures, Human Rights Watch said.Sri Lanka has ratified core international human rights treaties that obligate the government to protect the rights of individuals against violence, discrimination, and other type of abuses by both private actors and government officials and agents.There is increasing recognition that a stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s failure to provide transgender people with a simple and accessible procedure to change their gender on official documents violates their rights. A joint statement in 2015 by 12 United Nations agencies, ranging from UNICEF to the World Food Programme, called on governments to ensure Ã¢â‚¬Å“legal recognition of the gender identity of transgender people without abusive requirements,Ã¢â‚¬Â such as forced sterilization or treatment.Ã¢â‚¬Å“When transgender people carry documents that mention a sex or gender that does not match our identities, we face obstacles at every step,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Bhoomi Harendran, a transgender rights activist in Colombo.

However, the number and scale of attacks were reportedly fewer than in recent years, it said.The State Department also stated that although the constitution and other laws and policies protect religious freedom in Sri Lanka and, in practice, the government generally respected religious freedom, it did not demonstrate a trend toward either improvement or deterioration in respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom.U.S. embassy officials conveyed U.S. government concerns about religious freedom issues, particularly attacks on churches, to government leaders and urged them to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators.Pointing out that there were reports of abuses of religious freedom in the island nation, the report alleged that although the government publicly endorsed religious freedom, in practice there were problems in some areas. While the number of attacks against Christians continued to decline and efforts to pass anti-conversion legislation reportedly declined, some Christian groups occasionally complained that the government tacitly condoned harassment and violence aimed at them, states the State Department report on religious freedom in the world.There also were reports of government troops setting up Buddhist shrines in Tamil areas of the north, with some Tamil groups claiming this was a sign of government-sponsored Sinhalese colonization of former LTTE-held areas, added the report released by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.For the United States, of course, religious freedom is a cherished constitutional value, a strategic national interest, and a foreign policy priority, she remarked at the Release of the 2011 International Religious Freedom Report in Washington. 2011 International Religious Freedom Report - Sri Lanka ",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=19032,12,,Other Ethnic groups,News

28,"                   An international human rights group on Friday warned that the militarization of Sri Lankas former war zone and discrimination against minority ethnic Tamils threaten to lead the island back into violence.The Brussels-based International Crisis Group said in a report that there are government moves to change the demographics in what were once Tamil majority areas by sending in ethnic Sinhalese settlers. By adopting policies that will bring fundamental changes to the culture, demography and economy of the Northern Province, the government of Sri Lanka is sowing the seeds of future violence there, the report said.Fridays ICG report alleged that important decisions of governance in the north were now being made by Sinhalese military officials and politicians at the exclusion of the local Tamil people and their elected leaders. The predominantly Tamil north now has streets and villages renamed in the Sinhala language, dotted with war monuments and Buddhist shrines, the religion of the majority.Many of these are built on land that Tamils left behind during the height of the conflict, it said.The ICG called on aid agencies supporting Sri Lankas postwar reconstruction to demand change in government policies and not to pay for policies that may lead to violence.The government has continuously denied that it follows a policy of exclusion and says it is not creating Sinhalese settlements.While the situation is calm now, the Tamil population is exhausted by war, broken by defeat and, after decades of LTTE (Tamil Tigers) tight control, sadly acclimatized to authoritarian rule, it will not necessarily remain that way, the report said.

However, the use of INR as a designated foreign currency in Sri Lanka is subject to any restrictions imposed by RBI, the CBSL added.Authorising INR as a designated foreign currency stands to bring many advantages to Sri Lanka including the facilitation of smooth banking transactions relating to INR especially for small-scale traders, encouraging traders to use banking channels for trade transactions over informal channels, reducing additional transaction costs associated with the dual conversion of INR into USD and thereafter into LKR and vice-versa.Moreover, since India remains a large source country for tourism in Sri Lanka, authorizing INR as a designated foreign currency for banking transactions would add more convenience to Indian tourists, according to the CBSL.The media release read that the CBSL from time to time, authorizes selected foreign currencies as designated foreign currencies with a view to facilitating international trade and cross-border banking transactions.Commencing May 1979, the CBSL has occasionally recognized designated foreign currencies.According to the CBSL, at present, 16 currencies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Danish Kroner, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, New Zealand Dollar, Norwegian Kroner, Pound Sterling, Singapore Dollar, Swedish Kroner, Swiss Franc, Thai Bhat and US Dollar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have been authorized as designated foreign currencies under the provisions of the Banking Act and the Foreign Exchange Act, with the latest inclusion being the INR in August 2022.",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=92395,1,,Other Ethnic groups,News

35,"President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said that Sri Lanka has appointed a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers with representation from multiple political parties, and that they are fostering ongoing discussions in Parliament towards forming a national consensus on the way forward.The President made these remarks addressing the 27th International Conference on the Future of Asia (Nikkei) held in Tokyo, Japan, via video call on Thursday (26).JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nikkei newspaper has been organizing the conference annually since 1995. The theme of this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two day conference is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Redefining AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Role in a Divided WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â.The President pointed out that as Sri Lanka is AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest democracy. It is crucial that the solutions to our present national crisis are supported through our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s democratic framework.Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe virtual shutting down of the tourism industry and the sharp decline in inward remittances from expatriate workers due to COVID19 in the past two years and increasing inflation due to other events combined with Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high outstanding debt obligations to cause a severe financial crisis,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the President said.In April, Sri Lanka announced a Ã¢â‚¬ËœDebt StandstillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with the intention of restructuring this external public debt through negotiations with our creditors, whilst simultaneously approaching the International Monetary Fund for a suitable programme.Ã¢â‚¬ËœAs we work through such solutions, however, we urgently require the assistance of our friends in the international community to ensure that our immediate needs in terms of the importation of essential medicines, food supplies, and fuel are metÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, President Rajapaksa added.Ã¢â‚¬ËœJapan remains one of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key development partners, and we hope that the negotiations now underway regarding bridging funds from Japan will conclude soon, and support Sri Lanka as we try to stabilise our economy and our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the President said.President Rajapaksa appealed to the other friends of Sri Lanka, to also explore the possibility of extending support and solidarity to our country at this very difficult time.Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe grave difficulties facing Sri Lanka are an early indication of the long tail effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, made worse by the ongoing conflict in Europe that may affect other vulnerable nations too. Supporting such vulnerable nations through these difficulties is essential for regional as well as global stabilityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the President said.Ã¢â‚¬ËœAn even more widespread problem that the world will face in future concerns food security. The shortages of food items and sharp increases in food prices likely to occur in the months ahead will place considerable strain on many countriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the President further said.It is therefore essential that we pay attention to this crucial problem and prioritise agricultural production locally and improve our resilience in the face of this coming issue.

36,"Civil society organisations in Sri Lanka have expressed concern over the newly appointed Chairman of the Right to Information (RTI) Commission, while also reiterating that the composition of the commission needs to ensure representation of minorities.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last week appointed new members to the five-member RTI Commission after the term of the previous members expired in September this year.The new RTI Commission is headed by retired Supreme Court Justice Upali Abeyratne and includes former member retired President of the Court of Appeal Justice Rohini Walgama, Athulasiri Samarakoon, Senior Lecturer, Department of Political and International Affairs, Department of Sociology, Open University; former member Attorney-at-Law Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, and Attorney-at-Law Liyana Arachchilage Jagath Bandara Liyana Arachchi.However, issuing a joint statement today, several civil society groups in the country stated that the newly appointed Chairman of the Commission was unsuitable to hold the position and that the composition of the commission needs to ensure representation of minorities as well as individuals who are natively fluent in all official languages of the country.Read the full press release below:The passing of the RTI Act was not only eagerly awaited by the people of the country, it also proved to be a turning point in the social and political situation in our country. The adoption of the legislation can also be seen as a victory for the civil society of the country who strive to create a more a-political system of democracy and governance in the land.With the tenure of the first RTI Commission coming to an end earlier this year, a new RTI Commission was appointed. The appointments were made by the President based on the recommendations of the parliamentary council, as set out in the 20th amendment to the constitution.As a group of individuals who have been working to ensure the right to information of the citizens of the country, our attention was focused on the appointment of the new RTI Commission. We signed the earlier press release to indicate that the newly appointed Chairman of the Commission was unsuitable to hold the position. This stance remains unchanged and was the primary focal point of the earlier press release.We also wish to clarify our stance regarding the composition of the RTI commission. We reiterate that the composition of the commission needs to ensure representation of minorities as well as individuals who are natively fluent in all official languages of the country. The recent resignation of one of the appointed commissioners provides an opportunity for the administration to rectify this situation. Our earlier press release was not meant to be a rejection or protest against the other commissioners that have already been appointed.We are of the firm belief that in order to uphold the reputation of the RTI Commission as well as to protect the important work that it carries out, an individual of integrity who is well respected in society should take the helm of the commission as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chairperson.Nadishani PereraÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Executive Director, Transparency International Sri LankaRohana HettiarachchiÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Executive Director, PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Action for Free and Fair ElectionsDr. Paikiasothy SaravanamuttuÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Executive Director, Centre for Policy AlternativesDr. Sakuntala KadirgamarÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Executive Director, Law & Society Trust (LST)Lionel Guruge- Senior Researcher, Centre for Policy AlternativesManjula GajanayakeÃ¢â‚¬â€œ National Coordinator, Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV)Philip DissanayakeÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Executive Director, Right to Life Human Rights CentreMaithreyi RajasingamÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Executive Director, ViluthuThilak KariyawasamÃ¢â‚¬â€œ President, Food First Information & Action Network of Sri Lanka (FIAN)Nishantha PreethirajÃ¢â‚¬â€œ National Organizer, National Deshodaya Assembly",OTHER,OTHER,Negative,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=79413,12,,Other Ethnic groups,News

90,"                   Australias Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed a Sri Lankan asylum seeker who died after suffering burns to 90 per cent of his body over the weekend had been receiving mental health support prior to his death. Twenty-nine-year-old Leo Seemanpillai had been living in the community on a bridging visa in Geelong prior to his death, which is believed to be self-inflicted.Seemanpillai died of his injuries after burns to 90% of his body and is the second Sri Lankan asylum seeker to have self-immolated in Australia this year.The Sri Lankan asylum seeker was flown from Geelong Hospital to The Alfred hospital in a critical condition, where he later died on Saturday.Addressing media on Monday, Mr Morrison said Mr Seemanpillai had been granted a bridging visa since his arrival in Australia in January 2013, but an application for a protection visa remained pending.He said the man had been receiving mental health support and had been visited by a case worker the Friday prior to his death.When asked if he would take responsibility over the incident as Immigration Minister, Mr Morrison replied that it was a terrible and tragic occurrence.Mr Morrison rejected claims Sri Lankans had abandoned hope following his comment last October that anyone who may have come from Sri Lanka should know that they will go back to Sri Lanka.He said today: Claims are assessed in accordance with the process. Theyre not assessed by me.Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam has told Fairfax Media that Mr Seemanpillai was fearful of being sent back to Sri Lanka, where he would face persecution from the military.Hes been in limbo ever since he got here in terms of his visa situation, and this coupled with his depression and fear of being sent back, Mr Grant said.People have left tributes to Mr Seemanpillai on the Councils Facebook page, describing him as someones son, brother, friend.The fear of being sent back to persecution in Sri Lanka drove him to this act of self immolation and it will not be the last, one commenter posted.Without permanent protection, people have no assurance of their ongoing safety. With no allowance for family reunification, their loved ones continue to suffer human rights abuses in their homelands. This forces asylum seekers to live in constant despair and without any hope for the future.A memorial service will be held for Mr Seemanpillai this Friday from 6pm at St Marys Catholic Church, High Street Thornbury.The service, which will be held in Tamil and English, is being organised by the Darebin Ethnic Communities Council and the DASSP-Darebin Asylum Seeker Support Project.

92,"Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has denied abandoning traumatised war survivors in Sri Lanka by closing down a mental health project in the north.Despite massive needs, the decision was made because MSF no longer deems it an emergency, the medical charity said.MSF announced on April 5 that it was shutting down a programme counselling survivors of the Indian Ocean Islands almost three-decade-long conflict, most of whom witnessed the deaths of loved ones.There are still clearly massive mental health needs, but we felt that this was not something that MSF could continue as it requires longer-term support, Katrien Coppens, MSFs Sri Lanka operations manager, told Reuters by phone from Amsterdam.We talked to many people - patients, authorities, staff - and there were different feelings about us closing down, she added. Of course, people were not happy that we were leaving... and the sense that people felt abandoned is partly true, but not a feeling I got across the board.Almost three years since Sri Lankas civil war ended, experts say thousands of people are still living in torment, haunted by memories of the final months of fighting between separatist Tamil Tigers and government forces.As a result, many of the war-affected exhibit anti-social behaviour and experience flashbacks, hallucinations, nightmares and suicidal thoughts.Mental stress over poor rehabilitation and resettlement, combined with a lack of jobs and hope, has also driven men, in particular, to alcoholism. There have been many reports of domestic violence, child abuse and family separation in war-hit communities. MSFs mental health project had run for 18 months in the islands war-torn northern district of Kilinochchi, providing one-to-one counselling for almost 500 patients.Coppens said the decision to close it had been difficult because of the ongoing need for support.MSF opens a project knowing that when the situation changes, we will eventually shift our resources to other emergency crises. Knowing when to open is pretty easy, she said.Deciding when to close is always less clear. Closures are always difficult because the situation is never perfect, but it is time for MSF to put its resources into operations that are more in line with our mandate as an emergency humanitarian relief organization, she added.Coppens said MSF is continuing mental health support in the neighbouring district of Mullaitivu. She is hopeful that other agencies, as well as the Sri Lankan authorities, will honour commitments to provide aid of this kind.Restrictions on aid groups working in the former war zone have now been removed, she said. This should help bring in better-equipped charities to train doctors and nurses, and mainstream mental health support into general public healthcare.

98,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that a bill on gender equality and womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empowerment will be submitted to Parliament soon and he has instructed the women parliamentariansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ caucus to prepare the bill.The President emphasized that womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representation should be increased not only in the Parliament but also in other sectors and the public sector as well as the private sector should focus their attention in this regard.The President pointed out that the representation of women in the First Council of Sri Lanka was 2% and 91 years after universal suffrage, the representation of women in the current parliament is only 5.3%.President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these observations by joining the Committee Stage Debate on the budget proposal for the financial year 2023 in parliament today (01).The President further said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I expect to speak especially on the Ministry under me. We thank the Women ParliamentariansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Caucus for commencing a 16-day campaign against Gender-Based Violence (GBV).It was in 1931 that Sri Lankans got the universal franchise. However, the State Council did not have any female representation. The group of females including former President Chandrika KumaratungaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother requested the Donoughmore Commission to permit the females to contest at the election as well. At the election, not a single female won a seat. Eight months later after the demise of my great grandfather J H Meedeniya, Mrs Mollamure was appointed. On the other hand, Mrs Florence Senanayake was appointed from the opposition side. Hence, the female representation in 1931 was 2 per cent and after 91 years after the universal franchise was achieved, we have increased the female representation up to 5.3 per cent which is not satisfactory.However, the UK parliament did not have 2 per cent female representation in 1931but Canada, Lok Sabha, Australia etc have increased it by now. We all are responsible for not doing so. In 2015 we proposed to increase the female representation at the Provincial Councils but could do it due to the amendment. However, the proportion of females in our society is 52 per cent. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why I asked the Women Parliamentarians Caucus to attend to that matter. We are drafting two acts related to Gender Equality and Women Empowerment. It is also proposed to establish an independent commission under the name of the National WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Commission to give leadership and make recommendations to the Parliament to intervene in matters relating to gender equality and women empowerment. The government supports it and I hope the Opposition side too would support it. We also have planned to appoint a female Ombudsman.We have much to talk about on this matter. When we look at the estate sector, and garment factories, most of the employees are females but there is not a single woman director in them. Not only the Private sector but the government sector too has done the same mistake, as the scenario in the Corporations is the same. We can address it by way of law.However, where the education sector, health and administrative sector are concerned, female representation is higher. But in the private sector, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find this development and it should be improved. But when we look at the numbers receiving education, more than 50 per cent are female which is not reflected at the higher level of employment.In addition, the Women ParliamentariansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Caucus has been assigned to attend to Child affairs as well. The number of orphan children being looked after by the government is very low. The Caucus has to look into the protection of those children as well. We have to attend to the matter of elders and disabled persons. The amount that we can allocate for them has dropped as we settle loans, paid salaries or maintained loss-making institutions. But the curtain and what is in front of the curtain are nice. But nobody is looking behind a different curtain. Earlier this ministry was not considered to be important under any government but now we are considering granting other ministries to female members. In India Finance Ministry, and Defence Ministry were held by females. Liz Truss was also the Foreign Minister. So we should attend to these matters and hence I instructed the Women ParliamentariansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Caucus to propose to formulate the required laws. We have a responsibility to increase womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representation not only in parliament and politics but in all other areas as well.I also instructed the Minister to address the issues related to Samurdhi. The issue there is some needy people are not receiving Samurdhi benefits while some who are not needy are getting them. We have to remove those who are not eligible. Some decisions may not be popular but the Parliament should be strong to get the correct decision. Though I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talk much about education as the minister will address it. Do we need the same schools we had when free education was introduced in 1946 or the same schools we had in 1980? I think we need schools that look ahead to 25 years beyond 2023.The entire system that we are used to will change. MP Eran Wickramaratne will tell you all that we may not have brick-and-mortar universities at the end of the day. It could be something else. However, why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we be the regional hub for that?Sri Lanka can be a regional hub for education. Let us make up our minds. You are allowing billions of dollars to go out, at least three billion. So not only can we retain that 3 billion, but if we do it right, we will be able to attract another 10 billion. We must do that.Can we be saying these are students and taking in those who are 40-50 years and expect to rectify this system? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all I am saying. Some may attack me for it, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind. That is a fact. I said it earlier as well, earlier, we entered universities and passed out by the age of 21 or 22. Yet today, how many pass out by that age?I think many can pass out by the age of 21-22. We were law students at the time and we all passed out by that age. Yet, can this be done today? So are we going to face this issue or not? That is the question and that is why I ask if we are all going to face this issue and stop it.Young men and women must pass out and leave university by the age 21-22. Then they can have jobs. Now we have to tailor the courses to suit the job market. In the future, we may experience a shortage of job opportunities in the job market, especially in the arts and social science fields. Hence, I would like the national council and the other committees of parliament to focus their attention on this issue. This issue could only be resolved if the matter is presented to these committees. The only issue that remains is whether the government is going to do it alone or whether the Opposition will join with the government and support its program or whether they will get onto the streets and start protesting. So we have to decide which course of action we are going to take. Developing the education sector is a step taken for the betterment of the future generations.Ã¢â‚¬Â--PMD",WOMEN,OTHER,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=86529,49,,Women,News

100,"Miss South Africa was crowned Miss Universe on Sunday in Atlanta after a lavish ceremony filled with glitter and heartfelt speeches about female empowerment.Zozibini Tunzi, 26, finished first ahead of the Puerto Rican and Mexican finalists in a flashy televised event, hosted by American comic turned TV personality Steve Harvey.Television personalities Vanessa Lachey and Olivia Culpo served as backstage commentators, and a panel of seven women determined the winner.Tunzi earned cheers during her closing speech, a new segment of the competition, in which she talked about wanting to empower young women to feel confident.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me, with my kind of skin and my kind of hair, was never considered to be beautiful,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think that it is time that that stops today,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said to thunderous applause.Tunzi beat more than 90 contestants from around the globe in the 68th instalment of Miss Universe, which was held in AtlantaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tyler Perry Studios.The two favorites ahead of the competition, Miss Thailand Paweensuda Saetan-Drouin and Miss Philippines Gazini Ganados, did not make it to the final 10.The PhilippinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Catriona Gray, who presented Tunzi with the crown, took home the Miss Universe crown in 2018.Although she did not make the finals, Miss Myanmar Swe Zin Htet made waves last week when she came out as the competitionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first openly gay contestant.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have that platform that, if I say that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a lesbian, it will have a big impact on the LGBTQ community back in Burma,Ã¢â‚¬Â Htet told People magazine, using her countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historic name.Homosexuality is illegal in the southeast Asian country and is punishable by up to life in prison.In 2018, the competition also featured Miss Spain Angela Ponce, who blazed a trail as Miss UniverseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first transgender contestant.But the pageant has had a controversial past. Multiple contestants have alleged that US President Donald Trump would regularly enter the competitorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ changing room while he owned the organization from 1996-2015.Additionally, Miss Universe continues to host the swimsuit competition, which has drawn criticism for objectifying the contestants, although that part of the pageant was not televised.-Agencies",WOMEN,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=59533,14,,Women,News

Bandara recently told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that storing paddy at the Mattala International Airport was discussed with the relevant authorities as there had been limited facilities to store paddy back in 2015.However, the authorities of the Airport had strictly rejected the idea, Mr. Bandara further told the Commission.He also stated that this was discussed at length with Minister Daya Gamage and as a decision was taken at the time to store paddy at the Airport due to the promises given during election campaigns, nearly 4000 metric tonnes of paddy was stored at the Airport.",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=58447,2,,Other Ethnic groups,News

Mr. Ramanayake further stated that it was because of such abuse of power that former president Rajapaksa has had to face various commissions of inquiry today. During the last presidential election campaign, President Rajapaksa was falsely accused of having ordered a private plane for himself. Now they say fairly truthfully, that this was only a kit to convert a part of an ordinary airliner into a luxury cubicle. These are VIP conversion kits which can be installed after removing several seats in commercial airliners and are supplied free as a complimentary accessory when new commercial passenger planes are ordered. Airbus Industries mentions a value for this conversion kit only to give the customer an idea of the value of the complimentary kit. The customer canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask for the money instead of the complimentary accessory.Though Mr. Ramanayake said in his press conference that the President of the USA and the Sultan of Brunei also used similar units on their planes, that is not true. The American President travels in an official plane and the Sultan of Brunei has many private planes. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t travel on commercial airlines fitted with conversion kits.It is not correct to say that the government cannot reverse the order for this VIP kit. Any customer can turn down the offer of a complimentary accessory if he does not need it. It seems to be that the present leaders now wish to avail themselves of the comfort of this VIP kit for their foreign travels and are trying to make excuses for accepting it by saying that the agreement prevented them from turning it down. All those who value yahapalanaya principles should ensure that the government flatly refuses to accept this complimentary VIP conversion kit and even if it is sent to Sri Lanka with the new planes, it should be returned to Airbus Industries forthwith.",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=34338,3,,Other Ethnic groups,News

117,"The General Assembly today voted unanimously to create a new body for accelerating gender equality and womensempowerment, crowning four-years of tough negotiations to streamline and raise the profile of the United Nations activities topromote the rights of women and girls.Diplomats erupted in rousing applause as the Assembly adopted a consensus resolution on system-wide coherence that wouldplace four existing United Nations bodies dealing with gender issues under a single umbrella; it will be known as UN Women. The resolution calls for the appointment of an Under-Secretary-General to head up the new body, and the establishment of anexecutive board to provide intergovernmental support to and supervision of its operational activities.Praising Member States for creating a much stronger voice for women and for gender equality at the global level, United NationsSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the move historic, and declared: It will now be much more difficult for the world toignore the challenges facing women and girls  or to fail to take the necessary action.Mr. Ban immediately named Deputy Secretary-General, Asha-Rose Migiro, to guide the transition process that would entail thedissolution of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the International Research and TrainingInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), and merge their mandates and functions with those of the Division forthe Advancement of Women and the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, to createthe new body, which would be operational by 1 January 2011.The Assembly makes clear in the resolution that the Beijing Platform for Action, adopted by the 1995 Fourth World Conferenceon Women, is the framework for the new bodys work.That landmark action plan calls for Governments to end discriminationagainst women and close the gender gap in 12 critical areas including education, employment, political participation and humanrights. Further to todays text, the policy-oriented activities of UN Women would be funded by the Organizations regularbudget, and its programmes and field operations would be funded by voluntary contributions.Acknowledging that the resolution would always be strongly associated with the establishment of UN Women, the Secretary-General stressed that the Assembly had also adopted today many important decisions in other areas of the system-widecoherence process. In the area of funding, Member States had agreed to introduce a new approach to determining the criticalmass of core funding for funds and programmes.Continuing, he said that Member States had also realized that the voice of programme countries was not always heard ingoverning bodies, by requesting those bodies to identify how to strengthen the participation of national policymakers in meetingsof the Executive Boards of funds and programmes and the operational activities segment of the Economic and Social Council. Such measures will enable programme countries, particularly the least developed, to participate in governing bodies on a moreequal basis, he added.Assembly President Ali Abdussalam Treki said the resolution illustrated the dedication and joint efforts of Member States andthe Secretariat to move forward together, with a stronger, more efficient United Nations. Our Organizations shortcomings arewell known: fragmented, costly and, at times, duplicative operational activities, he said, adding that improving the world bodyscoherence and effectiveness was vital to ensuring that it remained at the heart of the global multilateral system.Today is an important day, he continued, saying that the resolution seeks to institutionalize our joint efforts to empower one ofthe worlds greatest assets: women. UN Women would be both a normative body and an operational one, acting as asecretariat and carrying out operational activities, such as guidance and technical support, at the country level. Importantly, theresolution also charged UN Women with an additional mandate; that of coordinating the United Nations systems activities ongender issues, including gender mainstreaming.Delegations taking the floor after the adoption of the resolution hailed the creation of UN Women as historic, saying the newbody would put women at the forefront of the international agenda and provide support for countries to strengthen nationalcapacities towards womens advancement. They also praised the Assembly Presidents leadership, as well as the hard work ofhis co-facilitators, Tiina Intelmann (Estonia) and Ghazi Jomaa (Tunisia).Speaking on behalf of the Joint Coordination Committee of the Group of 77 developing countries and China and the Non-Aligned Movement, Moushira Khattab, Minister of State for Family and Population of Egypt, underscored that dissolving thetwo entities  UNIFEM and INSTRAW  and transferring their mandates and functions to the new entity should not forfeitthe expertise of current staff.She said that the Joint Committee looked forward to a smooth transition, without programme interruption or staff suffering fromthe change. After all, UNIFEM, the Division for the Advancement of Women, INSTRAW and the Office of the SpecialAdviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women were the building blocks of UN Women and should be seen as assetsduring the transition period and when the new body became operational in January.Highlighting other aspects of the resolution, the representative of the Russian Federation praised important measures aimed atavoiding duplication and said he was satisfied with the balanced, agreed wording regarding financing, harmonization and othersubjects. He noted that the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) must preserve its formalstatus, and he welcomed the Delivering as One pilot projects. Success depended on the reliability of assessment bodies,and the Russian Federation was ready to participate actively. Still, the text was presently no more than just a document; itseffective implementation would the responsibility of Member States, he said.The Minister of State for External Affairs of India also delivered a statement, as did the representatives of Belgium (speaking onbehalf of the European Union), Australia (speaking also on behalf of Canada and New Zealand), Estonia, Tunisia, United States,Rwanda, Republic of Korea, Cuba, Colombia, Botswana, United Republic of Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Japan, Chile,Mexico, Norway and South Africa.The General Assembly will reconvene at a date and time to be announced. - (United Nationa general Assembly) ",WOMEN,OTHER,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=8809,35,,Women,News

Text of full speech:Mr. President of the Sixty Sixth Session of the GeneralAssembly, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is with great pleasure that I congratulate YourExcellency Nassir Abdul Aziz Al-Nasser on your assumption of the Presidency. Imust also congratulate His Excellency Ban-ki-Moon warmly on his re-election asSecretary-General and we look forward to working with him constructively.As we gather here today, it is appropriate to reflect on thevalues and ideals which inspire the United Nations system. One of the principalattributes is the spirit of flexibility which has always been a feature of theUnited Nations. We must acknowledge the need for that spirit of openness andadaptability today, more than at any other time. This is because thefoundations of the world order, are being transformed dramatically andfundamentally. At the heart of these changes is the need to protect smallercountries in the developing world and to advance their interests vigorously.In the midst of uncertainty there are some things which mustremain constant. These reflect ouresteemed beliefs and convictions. Despite repeated references in this Assemblyby many member countries on the right of the Palestinian people to a State oftheir own within secure borders, we still have not been able to make it areality. It is a matter for profound disappointment that this has notyet happened. There is a window of opportunity now and we must make use of itbefore it is too late. It is time for decisive action rather than morediscussion. This will be in the interest of the security and the well being ofthe entire region including Israel. The need for sustained support for countries of the AfricanContinent at this critical time is also worthy of mention. It is important to remind ourselves that every countrycherishes the values and traditions, and deeply held religious convictions ithas nurtured over the centuries. Thesecannot be diluted or distorted under the guise of human rights, by theimposition of attitudes or approaches which are characteristics of aliencultures.If this were done, it would amount to a violation of humanrights in a fundamental sense. It must also be pointed out that even wheresanctions are imposed, extreme care has to be taken to ensure that the peopleat large, men, women and children yet to be born, are not harmed by suchaction. I would also express, once again, my solidarity with the people of Cubaand I wish them all success.Mr. President, Excellencies,Whilst clash of ideas, opinions and values continues we haveclearly to recognize that dialogue, deliberation and consensus offer the onlyviable means for resolving differences. The might of powerful nations cannotprevail against justice and fair play.In the troubled times in which we live, we can deriveguidance from the wise words of Gautama the Buddha who advised the LichchaviPrinces, whose energies were being consumed by bitter disputes among them, thatthe way forward consists of meeting, discussing and departing in an atmosphereof amity and goodwill. This represents the essential spirit of the UnitedNations, particularly relevant today.The most significant challenge to stability and progress inthe modern world is posed by the menace of terrorism. Recent experience theworld over amply demonstrates that inconsistent standards and discriminatingapproaches can unintentionally give a fresh lease of life to the forces ofterror. An explicit and uniform response which refuses to recognize politicalshades of terrorism, is necessarily required.Terrorism presents a threat from which not even thewealthiest and most powerful of nations are immune. It must be remembered, aswell, that terrorist groups frequently operate under the guise of front organizations. Conferring legitimacy on these has theinevitable effect of providing comfort and encouragement to the merchants ofterror. As the leader of a nation which has paid a heavy price dueto terrorism over a quarter of a century, I would underline that we must firmlyresolve to rid the world of terrorism. We need to have solid practical actionon the ground, and send out our collective message on this issue loud and clearuniversally.Mr. President, Excellencies,The interest of the developing world needs to be protectedin another significant respect. It is vitally important to insist that thestructures and procedures of multilateral organizations are uniform andconsistent and devoid of discrimination.My country has reason for concern with approaches tainted byan unacceptable degree of selectivity, which we have brought to the notice ofthe organizations in question in recent weeks. The developing world must keep avigil against these irregular modalities which should be resisted through ourcollective strength.After three decades of pain and anguish, today, Sri Lankansof all ethnicities, living in all parts of Sri Lanka, are free from LTTE terrorand no longer live in a state of fear.However, I am deeply mindful that the battle for peace isevery bit as important and difficult as the struggle against terror. After theeradication of terrorism, my government has turned its undivided attention tobuilding anew, the foundations of a unified and vibrant nation and drawing uponthe inherent strengths of our country and in particular, the unique caliber ofour human potential. It is justifiable for us to be proud of our nationsachievements during the brief span of thirty months which have elapsed sincethe beginning of the post-conflict phase. The resettlement of more than 95% ofinternally displaced persons, who constituted the largest number of civiliansforcibly held by a terrorist group at any time, while continuing even today toclear the mines laid by terrorists in extensive areas is a proudachievement. Today, in the Northern province, the Armed Forces areengaged in development of the infrastructure which were destroyed by theterrorists during a period of three decades. Contrary to malicious propaganda,the numbers of the Armed forces present in the Northern province is at aminimal level. Revival of the economy has enhanced incomes and improvedlivelihoods, ex-combatants and other cadres after exposure to programmes ofvocational training and counseling have been re-integrated into society,electoral process has been restored after decades making possible the emergenceof a democratic leadership. These are among our valued accomplishments.The remarkable growth of 22% of the economy of the NorthernProvince is a clear indication of the success achieved by the governmentsinitiatives with regard to development in that part of the country. The GDPgrowth of the country has been consistent at 8 percent, unemployment at arecord low of 4.5 percent and it is also worthy of mention that in theassessment by the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report for2011 - 2012 Sri Lanka shows dramatic improvement, moving up to 52nd from 79thrank over a span of two years.It is worthy of note that all these developments have takenplace within the brief space of 30 months  an achievement all the more significantbecause of our strong emphasis on reconciliation. Important as economicdevelopment is, we have attached the highest priority to fostering the spiritof inclusivity and removing any remnants of bitterness from the hearts andminds of all our people.Over the last thirty months, we have recruited 669 Tamilpolice officers bringing the total number of Tamil officers to 1143 while plansare afoot to recruit more this year and in the future. After more than two decades, a census is being conducted inthe Northern province as a part of the national census, to provide a firm basisfor our initiatives. As a result of these achievements what we see in Sri Lankatoday is a self-reliant nation, with robust hope for the future, and a strongeconomy, strengthened by inward investment flows, unprecedented expansion oftourism and significant growth of volumes of international trade.Towards consolidation of these trends, leaving behind us,the trauma of the past, we ask of the international community the hand offriendship and goodwill, based on understanding of our nations determinationto confront with courage the challenge of a new era in our history.We ask our friends in distant lands to drop pre-conceivednotions. We strongly believe in home-grown solutions for them to besustainable. It is clearly impractical to conceive of universal remedies forproblems which afflict our societies.My country, as it comes out of the darkness of the lastthree decades into the light and promise of the future, must be afforded thetime and space to seek its destiny in accordance with the wishes of its people.It is in keeping with the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nationsand the whole body of international law which governs us. A further consideration that the international communityshould take into account is the vulnerability of developing nations and makeprovision, by means of appropriate institutional arrangements, for theirprotection.As I observed when inaugurating the fiftieth anniversarymeeting of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee in Colombo threemonths ago, dumping of commercial and industrial goods manufactured indeveloped countries imperils the economies of many Asian and African countriesrepresented here.Mr. President, Excellencies,In conclusion, let me say that the use of substantialsubsidies by Treasuries and Reserve Banks to support agricultural production inthe developed world, and other forms of protectionism, cause serious distortionof the interplay of market forces, and reduce to a great extent the ability offarmers in many developing countries to access international markets for theirexport products on an equitable basis. The disproportionate pollution of the environment byindustrialized countries, and the resultant impact on global warming andclimate change, cannot be remedied with any semblance of justice by imposingharsh restraints on developing countries which have contributed very little toaggravation of the problem. These circumstances heighten the importance ofsocial equity at the international level.May the Noble Triple Gem bless you all! Theruwan Saranai!

Five of them were found guilty of directly participating in the killing and handed death sentences that were later commuted to 20-year prison terms, while three others were jailed for seven to 10 years for covering up the crime.The Saudi trial was dismissed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the antithesis of justiceÃ¢â‚¬Â by then-UN Special Rapporteur AgnÃƒÂ¨s Callamard, who concluded that Khashoggi was Ã¢â‚¬Å“the victim of a deliberate, premeditated executionÃ¢â‚¬Â.A 2019 report by Ms Callamard said Saudi prosecutors ordered the arrest of Mr Alotaibi as part of an investigation into KhashoggiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder but ultimately decided not to charge him.However, Mr Alotaibi is the subject of a Turkish arrest warrant and is being tried in absentia in Istanbul on a murder charge.Source: BBC-Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=79007,2,,Other Ethnic groups,News

His daughter filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles court seeking damages from Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was a top defense official in his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government, for alleged involvement in the killing.Gotabaya is a U.S citizen and he has started the process to renounce it because dual citizens canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold political office in Sri Lanka.

145,"One month after the Sri Lanka suicide attacks that killed more than 250 people, investigators have told AFP the bombers used Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mother of SatanÃ¢â‚¬Â explosives favoured by the ISIS group that are a new sign of foreign involvement.Detectives said the back-pack bombs used in the April 21 attacks on three churches and three hotels were manufactured by local jihadists with ISIS expertise.They named the explosive as triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, an unstable but easily made mixture favoured by ISIS militants who call it Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mother of SatanÃ¢â‚¬Â.It was also used in the 2015 attacks in Paris, by a suicide bomber who hit the Manchester Arena in England in 2017 and attacks on churches in Indonesia one year ago.ISIS has claimed the Sri Lankan bombers operated as part of its franchise. But Sri Lankan and international investigators are anxious to know just how much outside help went into the attacks that left 258 dead and 500 injured.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The group had easy access to chemicals and fertiliser to get the raw materials to make TATP,Ã¢â‚¬Â an official involved in the investigation told AFP.Sri Lankan detectives say the National Thowheeth JamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ath (NTJ), local militants blamed for the attacks, must have had foreign help to assemble the bombs.Multinational militantsÃ¢â‚¬Å“They would have had a face-to-face meeting to transfer this technology. This is not something you can do by watching a YouTube video,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Investigators had initially believed that C4 explosives -- a favoured weapon of Tamil Tiger rebels -- were used, but forensic tests found TATP which causes more burning than C4.Police have also confirmed that 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of explosives found in January in the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s northwest was TATP.They are checking the travel records of the suicide bombers as well as foreign suspects to see when and where bomb-making lessons could have been staged.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It looks like they used a cocktail of TATP and gelignite and some chemicals in the Easter attacks. They were short of the 100 kilos of raw TATP that were seized in January,Ã¢â‚¬Â said the investigator.Sri Lankan security forces have staged a series of raids since the bombings. Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said Sunday that 89 suspects are in custody.Army chief Mahesh Senanayake said last week that at least two suspects have been arrested in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, underscoring the international link.On April 26, six militants, three widows of the suicide bombers and six of their children were killed at an NTJ safe house near the eastern coastal town of Kalmunai.Police found large quantities of chemicals and fertilizer there that was probably meant to make bombs, authorities said.The government has admitted that Indian warnings of the looming attacks in early April were ignored.But President Maithripala Sirisena has said eight countries are helping the investigation. A US Federal Bureau of Investigation team is in Sri Lanka and Britain, Australia and India have provided forensic and technical support.China offered a fleet of vehicles to bolster the mobility of the security forces tracking down militants.Ã¢â‚¬ËœContact with IslamistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢The Sri Lankan who led the attacks, Zahran Hashim, was known to have travelled to India in the months before he became one of the suicide bombers.Moderate Muslims had warned authorities about the radical cleric who first set off alarm bells in 2017 when he threatened non-Muslims.He was one of two bombers who killed dozens of victims at ColomboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shangri-La hotel on April 21.Army chief Senanayake said Hashim had travelled to Tamil Nadu state in southern India and been in contact with Islamists there.Hashim, one of seven bombers who staged the attacks, also appeared in an ISIS group video that claimed responsibility for the attacks.Another bomber who was meant to have hit a fourth hotel, has been named as Abdul Latheef Jameel who studied aviation engineering in Britain and Australia.Authorities in the two countries are investigating whether he was radicalised whilst abroad.Jameel blew himself up when confronted at a hideout after the attacks.Source: AFP-Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=55272,4,,Other Ethnic groups,News

150,"An arrest warrant for a former Sri Lankan military attache, convicted of public order offences after making cut-throat gestures at protesters, has been revoked without a court hearing following UK Foreign Office involvement.The private prosecution of Brig Priyanka Fernando has degenerated into extraordinary legal confusion, forcing the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, to take control of the case.On Friday, she told Westminster magistrates court there had been a catalogue of Ã¢â‚¬Å“disappointingÃ¢â‚¬Â issues and she did not know how such a sensitive case could have gone to trial without it Ã¢â‚¬Å“ever coming across my deskÃ¢â‚¬Â.Fernando was filmed making cut-throat gestures aimed at Tamil protesters outside the Sri Lankan high commission in London on 4 February 2018. Demonstrators were highlighting concerns about human rights violations against Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tamil minority. Footage of the incident went viral on YouTube.Following his provocative gesture, the Sri Lankan government condemned Fernando for behaving in an Ã¢â‚¬Å“offensive mannerÃ¢â‚¬Â and suspended him from his job. The Foreign Office (FCO) also protested; Fernando left the UK shortly afterwards.Majuran Sathananthan and four others involved in the Tamil protest initiated a private prosecution against Fernando arguing that his behaviour caused them Ã¢â‚¬Å“harassment, alarm and distressÃ¢â‚¬Â and constituted public order offences. They were represented by Paul Heron, of the Public Interest Law Centre (PILC).Last week the brigadier was convicted in his absence at Westminster magistrates court of two offences under section 4A and section 5 of the Public Order Act which involve using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Fernando, who remains in Sri Lanka.The conviction appears to have triggered a stream of diplomatic exchanges, with the UK ambassador in Sri Lanka called in for meetings.After consultations with the FCO over the status and extent of FernandoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diplomatic immunity, the chief magistrate abruptly withdrew the arrest warrant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a decision made without a public hearing.At the hearing on Friday, Fernando was, for the first time, represented in court. Peter Carter QC, for the protesters, outlined a series of Ã¢â‚¬Å“rather unusualÃ¢â‚¬Â options to deal with the case, including determining the diplomatic status of Fernando.Carter said that even if the brigadier had enjoyed immunity for official functions, that would not protect him from prosecution for what was clearly not authorised activity.Nick Wayne, counsel for Fernando, suggested using section 142 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980, a rarely used power to reopen cases where a mistake has been made.Belinda McRae, counsel for the FCO, confirmed that the court had been given a certificate explaining FernandoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diplomatic status. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until 1 March for a full hearing to resolve the legal confusion.Before the hearing, an FCO spokesperson said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FCO, which is not a party to these legal proceedings, has been contacted by Westminster magistrates court seeking clarification of the brigadierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diplomatic status in the UK at the time of the incident. The FCO is providing documentation to assist the court.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSource: The Guardian-Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=53020,9,,Other Ethnic groups,News

However by participating in election propaganda activities of a political party contesting for an area under his command, Chandrasiri has shown that he is not an independent person, he said.It is of great importance that an individual holding an important and an honourable position acts in an impartial manner during an election period. This is doubly important for the Governor heading a Provincial Council in which there is an election as he is to convene the Provincial Council elected on September 21, Tennakoon said. He pointed out that although a Governor can have apolitical opinion, it is not ethical for him to engage in politics, as he is, first and foremost, a public servant and not a slave of a political party. By attending election propaganda activities Chandrasiri has shown his political bias. In the recent past Governor of the Northwestern Province Tissa R Balalla engaged in similar activities but he seems to have stopped such actions, at least temporarily, after continuous lobbying by election stakeholders, Tennakoon added. While respecting Northern Province Governors right to political opinion, CaFFE reiterates that he should resign from his position if he wants to continue engaging in politics. If not he will have no moral right to continue as Governor after the September 21 Provincial Council elections.

185,"                   Campaigners have called for a review of the involvement of Scottish police in training Sri Lankan security forces amid concerns over the countrys human rights record.More than 3500 Sri Lankan police officers - including some senior commanders - have received training from the Scottish Police College (SPC) since 2007 through projects funded by the UK and Scottish governments.An investigation by not-for-profit research group Corporate Watch also found the SPC is involved in spearheading a project to help to set up a National Police Academy in Sri Lanka. Most of the training involves Scottish officers travelling to the island, but in some cases Sri Lankan police are brought to Scotland.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay last week launched an attack on the Sri Lankan governments human rights record following a week-long visit, citing police intimidation of priests, journalists and human rights advocates. Pillay also talked of dissenting voices being permanently silenced.Phil Miller, from Corporate Watch, said: She reported the country was heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction and complained about how the police had been harassing people who she had been trying to interview.The police were prepared to be abusive even when the UN was there and its the Scottish Police College who have been doing a lot of training over the past six years.I think that raises some quite serious questions. If the country is going in a more authoritarian direction and Scottish police have been helping train the Sri Lankan police for the past six years, are they just helping to develop the police state? Do they have any concerns that this project isnt working?The training by Scottish police officers took place both before and after the governments final counter-insurgency campaign against the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009.Campaigners say major concerns still remain over the countrys human rights record.Mark Bevan, programme director for Amnesty International in Scotland, said: Unlawful detentions, torture, and enforced disappearances remain rife in Sri Lanka and go unpunished. Its shocking to think similar activity may have taken place while Scottish Police College training work and Scottish police officers were in the country.We would urge the college to investigate its engagement with the Sri Lankan police force and review their activity in light of Navi Pillays report.Furthermore, we would expect them to take the strongest measures possible to ensure any Scottish police staff working with or in Sri Lanka to strongly condemn violations of human rights and in no way contribute to or suppresses reporting of these brutal violations.A spokesman for Police Scotland said the SPC had an international reputation for the quality and integrity of its training packages, which are delivered in Scotland and across the world.He said: When the British Government supports justice and security projects, there are safeguards put in place to ensure any work does not contribute to human rights abuses and it has been clear from the outset that the training reform package in Sri Lanka, led by the SPC, aims to embed international standards in police training.There has also been widespread support for the project from opposition parties, UN and international humanitarian agency representatives, and non-governmental organisations.The Scottish Government confirmed it funded a Ã‚Â£400,000 training project which came to an end in March, with more than 3500 Sri Lankan officers receiving training.A spokesperson said: The aim of this project was to use the extensive expertise of the Scottish Police College and other agencies to develop a new model of community policing to help promote human rights in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is now classed as a middle income state. The decision to end funding was taken to allow the Scottish Government to focus on projects in poorer countries.The Foreign Office said the Scottish Police College received funding of Ã‚Â£236,042 from April 2007 to March 2013 for work in Sri Lanka via the Conflict Pool fund, which aims to reduce the impact of conflict and instability around the world.A spokeswoman added: Our police training reform project in Sri Lanka, led by the SPC, aims to embed international standards in police training.Opposition parties, UN and international humanitarian agency representatives, NGOs and others have indicated their firm support for our project.She added: Reform projects such as this one take time. We believe that our continued support will have a positive impact, in the interests of all of Sri Lankas communities. - Herald Scotland  ",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=24003,29,,Other Ethnic groups,News
186,"The JVP today charged that the only reasons Sri Lankas Police is unable to solve crimes carried out against journalists or media organizations is due to the governments direct involvement in them.JVP politburo member and parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the countrys police department is capable of solving any murder or incident which has caused controversy.However, their inability to apprehend any suspect in connection to the threats on journalists, attacks on media institutions and journo murders, clearly indicates that the government is directly behind these incidents, he said.He alleged that such threats, attacks and murders are being carried out under the governments advice, support and involvement. He stated that the nature of the break-in at Sunday Leader Associate Editor, Mandana Abeywickremas residence yesterday proves that it was much more than just a robbery.He inquired as to why a group of robbers would spend over 2 hours searching through documents and other such things and waste time.Five alleged burglars had broken into the house located in Dickmans Road at around 2.00am yesterday, before clashing with police officers who had responded to a call received by the police emergency hotline.Certain media reports had revealed that the suspects had searched for documents after breaking in and intended to kidnap Mrs. Abeywickrama, however the Police Spokesman rubbished these reports saying it was only an attempted armed robbery.In every other incident the government has failed to find and arrest the culprits or avoided doing so. However, in this incident one certain individual has been killed and several others have been arrested, Dissanayake said.He stated that now the entire history of these suspects such as their previous crimes and occupations, should be thoroughly investigated.On the visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the MP said that Navanethem Pillay is not coming to Sri Lanka, she is being brought down by the government using a palanquin (Dolawa).He charged that the action of the government has opened the door for the UN human right chief to carry out her agenda in the country.Anura Kumara further said that the present government only exists by marketing patriotism and not by serving and helping the masses.He said the country has a problem regarding dictatorship rule where from the Cabinet Minister to the average farmer, everyone is terrified.People are afraid to even draw a cartoon or criticize Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said.

190,"                   General Secretary of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Galaboda Aththe Gnanasara Thero, responding to an accusation over his involvement in a drunk driving incident in 2000, stated that it was a military officer who was driving the vehicle at the time and not him.In an interview on Derana 360 last night, the vociferous hardline monk was inquired regarding 9 charges, including driving under the influence of alcohol, driving without a valid license, driving without a revenue license and failing to report an accident, filed against him under case 6315/2000 at the Colombo Traffic Court. He was reportedly fined after pleading guilty to the charges. Responding to the question, Gnanasara Thero while not completely rejecting the accusations stated that the vehicle was driven by a military officer known to him.Certain things we can discuss in front of society. I can also answer this question without flinching and with a smile on my face, he said.He stated that the incident occurred when he was traveling with an army officer, who was driving the vehicle, and that when the incident was later reported by media and though the internet he was in America. At that time I asked that officer whether I should talk about the incident, about the truth. But he said the instruction he got was that it was now done and over. When asked why he did not come out with the truth as a Buddhist monk being accused, Gnanasara Thero said: There are some occasions where we have to remain silent.On the accusation that the police report clearly states that Galaboda Aththe Gnanasara Thero under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, he said it would take a long time for him to explain this and that he has does not need to prove his innocence. At that moment I needed to be unafraid to protect the army officer who came to help me and to assist my attempt on behalf of the Buddha Sasana, he said.He stated that a person was injured and hospitalized after the accident and that he would have been punished according to military law. That is why I said this is a complicated issue. So I think we should forget this and continue to the next question. We have discussed the needful, it is not a big deal. Gnanasara Thero was also questioned regarding a visit to Norway undertaken by him and four other monks in 2011, before the Buddhist nationalist group Bodu Bala Sena was founded in 2012, during which they had held talks with former Minister Erick Solheim and Tamil Diaspora groups.On this, he said the visit was aimed at helping the people in the North by gaining the assistance of the Tamil Diaspora in Norway which actually cared about the Tamil people of Sri Lanka.He, however, said unfortunately their intentions and goals were unfruitful due to pro-LTTE groups threatening the diaspora groups. He emphasized that the discussion were in no means aimed at conspiring against the country and that they were unable to inform the Sri Lankan High Commission in Norway due to the shortage of time during the visit. Galaboda Aththe Gnanasara Thero further said that there is no connection between the visit to the Norway in 2011 and the Bodu Bala Sena organization while terming accusation of the Buddhist nationalist group being funded by the Norway government as baseless and devoid of any truth.

200,"Acoalition of more than 70 partners, including the United States, pledged Sundayto send millions of dollars and communications equipment to Syrias oppositiongroups, signaling deeper involvement in the conflict amid a growing belief thatdiplomacy and sanctions alone cannot end the Damascus regimes repression.Theshift by the U.S. and its Western and Arab allies toward seeking to sway themilitary balance in Syria carries regional risks because the crisis thereincreasingly resembles a proxy conflict that could exacerbate sectariantensions. The Syrian rebels are overmatched by heavily armed regime forces.Thesummit meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People follows a year of faileddiplomacy that seems close to running its course with a troubled peace plan ledby U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.Indeed,U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other participants at theconference in Istanbul uniformly expressed concern that Annans plan mightbackfire, speculating that Syrian President Bashar Assad would try tomanipulate it to prolong his hold on power.Clintonsaid she was waiting for Annans report to the U.N. Security Council on Mondayon the status of his peace plan.Therecannot be process for the sake of process. There has to be a timeline. If Assadcontinues as he has, to fail to end the violence, to institute a cease-fire, towithdraw his troops from the areas he has been battering ... then its unlikelyhe is going to ever agree, she said. Because it is a clear signal that hewants to wait to see if he has totally suppressed the opposition. I think hewould be mistaken to believe that. My reading is that the opposition is gainingin intensity, not losing.Clintonsaid the United States is providing communications equipment to helpanti-government activists in Syria organize, remain in contact with the outsideworld and evade regime attacks.TheSyrian regime agreed last week to Annans plan, which calls for an immediatecease-fire, humanitarian access to besieged civilians and a politicalnegotiation process led by Syrians. Since then, there have been daily reportsof violence, including shelling Sunday in the central city of Homs thatactivists said killed more than two dozen people.Theuprising began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring with peaceful protestscalling for political reforms. Assads regime sent tanks, snipers and thugs totry to quash the revolt, and many in the opposition have taken up arms todefend themselves and attack government troops. The United Nations says morethan 9,000 have died.Conferenceparticipants in Istanbul said Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries arecreating a fund to pay members of the rebel Free Syrian Army and soldiers whodefect from the regime and join opposition ranks. One delegate described thefund as a pot of gold to undermine Assads army.Participantsconfirmed the Gulf plan on condition of anonymity because details were stillbeing worked out. One said the fund would involve several million dollars amonth. It is said to be earmarked for salaries, but it was not clear whetherthere would be any effort to prevent the diversion of money to weaponspurchases, a sensitive issue that could prompt stronger accusations of militarymeddling by foreign powers.Thedelivery of humanitarian aid to Syrias beleaguered civilians is a key provisionof Annans plan. Clinton announced $12 million in additional aid for Syriaspeople  doubling the total U.S. assistance so far.TheSaudis and other Arab Gulf states have proposed giving weapons to the rebels,while the U.S. and other allies have balked out of fear of fueling an all-outcivil war. Washington hasnt taken any public position on the fund, but itappears that it has given tacit support to its Arab allies.Mohammedal-Said, a Syrian activist in the town of Duma, northwest of Damascus, said salariesmight encourage further defections, but that only arms would turn the tideagainst Assad.Whatis clear to us is that only fighting can make this regime leave, he said viaSkype, adding the opposition wanted arms more than military intervention sothey could topple Assad themselves.FayezAmru, a rebel who recently defected from the military and is now based inTurkey, welcomed the decision as a humanitarian step in the right directionbut also said weapons were needed.Wefeel let down by the international community. I dont know why there ishesitation by the West ... maybe this will help at least keep the rebels ontheir feet, Amru said.InDamascus, Syria blasted the conference, calling it part of an internationalconspiracy to kill Syrians and weaken the country. A front-page editorial inthe official Al-Baath newspaper said the meeting was a regional andinternational scramble to search for ways to kill more Syrians, sabotage theirsociety and state, and move toward the broad objective of weakening Syria.Russiaand China have twice protected the Assad regime from censure by the U.N.Security Council, fearing such a step could lead to foreign militaryintervention. Syrias international opponents have no plans to launch amilitary operation similar to the Libya bombing campaign that ousted MoammarGadhafi, especially without U.N. support, but they are slowly overcoming doubtsabout assisting scattered rebel forces.Thedebate over arming or funding the rebels is being driven partly by thesectarian split in the region. The upheaval in Syria presents an opportunityfor the Sunni Muslim states in the Gulf to bolster their influence, consolidatepower and possibly leave regional rival Iran, led by a Shiite theocracy,without critical alliances that flow through Damascus.Assadsregime, which counts Iran among its few allies, is led by the minority Alawitesect, an offshoot of Shiism.Lastyear, Saudi Arabia sent tanks to help fellow Sunni leaders in Bahrain crush alargely Shiite rebellion there, indicating that sectarian interests sometimestrump calls for democratic change in the Middle East.Turkeyhosts 20,000 Syrian refugees, including hundreds of army defectors, and hasfloated the idea of setting up a buffer zone inside Syria if the flow ofdisplaced people across its border becomes overwhelming. Parts of the southernTurkish region near Syria are informal logistics bases for rebels, who collectfood and other supplies in Turkey and deliver them to comrades on smugglingroutes.Delegatesto the Istanbul meeting talked of tighter sanctions and increased diplomaticpressure on Assad, and Syrian opposition representatives promised to offer ademocratic alternative to his regime. Yet the show of solidarity at theconference was marred by the absence of China, Russia and Iran.TurkishPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said military options might have to beconsidered if Syria does not cooperate with Annans plan and the U.N. SecurityCouncil does not unite against Assad.Ifthe U.N. Security Council fails once again to bring about its historicresponsibility, there will be no other choice than to support the Syrian peoplesright to self-defense, Erdogan said.BurhanGhalioun, leader of the opposition Syrian National Council, called for the strengtheningof Syrian rebel forces as well as security corridors in Syria, a reference tointernationally protected zones on Syrian territory that would allow thedelivery of aid to civilians. However, the nations meeting in Istanbul failedto agree on such an intervention, which could involve the deployment of foreignsecurity forces.Noone should allow this regime to feel at ease or to feel stronger by giving thema longer maneuvering area, he said, reflecting fears that Assad would try touse the Annan plan to prolong his tenure. Its enough that the internationalcommunity has flirted with the regime in Syria. Something has to change.TheSyrian National Council said weapons supplies to the opposition were not ourpreferred option because of the risk they could escalate the killing ofcivilians, but it appealed for technical equipment to help rebels coordinate.Forthese supplies to be sent, neighboring countries need to allow for the transfervia their sea ports and across borders, the council said.Theone-day meeting followed an inaugural forum in Tunisia in February. Since then,Syrian opposition figures have tried to convince international sponsors thatthey can overcome their differences and shape the future of a country whoseautocratic regime has long denied the free exchange of ideas.InIstanbul, police used tear gas and batons to disperse a group of about 40 Assadsupporters who tried to approach the conference building. Many held portraitsof the Syrian leader. One man waved Chinese and Russian flags, CBS Newsreports.

201,"                   New York: There are few more knowledgeable observers of US-India relations than William H Avery, a former US diplomat, who served at the US Consulate in Chennai in the 1990s, a time when Indias relations with the US soured after New Delhis nuclear tests. In his new book, Chinas Nightmare, Americas Dream: India as the Next Global Power, Avery offers a detailed anatomy of the growing ties between the worlds largest and wealthiest democracies.Averys book also delivers a broadside against China and says India must respond to how China has advanced its influence in the region, with allies like Pakistan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. China has established itself as a growing, and sometimes bullying, power in Indias neighbourhood.India and most of the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have festering territorial disputes with China. Avery says India must respond to the Chinese challenge by spending even more on defence and using economic persuasion to influence its neighbours.India must now concentrate on the Finlandization of Sri Lanka, Avery writes, while referring to Finlands subjugation by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In the short term this will mean preventing any further non-Indian involvement in Sri Lankas affairs.Avery described how China invested millions to turn the sleepy fishing hamlet of Hambantota in Sri Lanka into a booming new port, just off Indias southeast coast, furthering an ambitious trading strategy in South Asia that is reshaping the region and forcing India to rethink relations with its neighbours.China has been developing port facilities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, and it is planning to build railroad lines in Nepal. These projects, analysts like Avery argue, are irksome to India; there are worries that China is expanding its sphere of regional influence by surrounding India with a string of pearls that could eventually undermine Indias pre-eminence and potentially rise to an economic and security threat.Avery worries that Indias economic growth since 1991 has not been matched by an appropriate increase in its global political clout. It is now, however, beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Obama administration, like the previous Bush administration, is investing in a long-term strategic partnership with India, and has identified China as a threat while declaring Asia as a priority to the US.India is no budding UK, and any US policymaker who believes New Delhi will act as a lieutenant for US interests has been smoking something herbal. But Avery suggests that New Delhi must build on recent economic successes to make India a truly global power. He suggests that where India sees common interests with the US  a wide and growing field  it should be more than willing to cooperate.India possesses the same core values that underpinned the Anglo-American relationship: democracy, human rights, the rule of law and the free market, Avery writes in his book.Despite rooting for a stronger India-US partnership, Avery compares Indias reliance on IT outsourcing, or supplying low-cost brains over the Internet to largely US companies, as a kind of colonial servitude. He implies that Indian firms are boosting efficiency for US companies with factory-like business processes. Today, he writes, India is falling in to the colonial trap all over again, except this time it is doing so willingly.The Wall Street Journal felt that Averys book, while thought-provoking, sort of missed the plot when it panned outsourcing which was a huge business opportunity.Its a fair point that IT outsourcing is draining Indias brightest minds from pursuing innovation. But to compare the industry to Indias plight under the British Empire, when the country exported raw materials and imported goods manufactured from those materials, is a step too far. (India, for instance, runs a large trade surplus with the US), wrote Tom Wright in The Wall Street Journal.Avery will warm the hearts of the folks opposing Wal-Marts march into India by arguing that India should think about more protection for its nascent industries at a time when its markets are growing and the West is stagnant. - FIRSTPOST ",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=16534,10,,Other Ethnic groups,News

203,"Kadawatha, Sri Lanka, August 2011: The official handover of the Vision Centre in Kadawatha by the International Centre for Eye care Education (ICEE) to Lions Golden Jubilee Trust for Healthcare and Skills Development took place recently. The event commemorated ICEEs successful involvement and collaboration with Lions since 2009.Since the Vision Centres establishment, it has successfully promoted eye care services within the Gampaha District and other distant areas of the country including Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Puttalam, through the Lions outreach camps. The Centre symbolises a remarkable achievement for ICEE, becoming the first Vision Centre to develop under the support and guidance of Lions Golden Jubilee Trust for Healthcare and Skills Development.ICEE Country Representative, Anitha Munasinghe, commenting on the progress and development of Vision Centre development in recent years said, By handing over the Kadawatha Vision Centre to the Lions Golden Jubilee Trust, we are expanding our services to accommodate the demand from the community. She added that the partnership between the two organisations was pivotal in the provision of full eye examinations, affordable low cost spectacles, and free cataract surgery to poor and deserving patients.Elaborating further, Ms. Munasinghe said, Patients referred from other ICEE Vision Centres throughout the country also receive free cataract surgery at the Golden Jubilee Hospital. Most of these patients would never have been able to afford cataract surgery on their own. Overall, the expansion of the hospital, would contribute towards the treatment of glaucoma and diabetes related eye care problems. The ICEE is very appreciative and commends the voluntary services of Consultant Ophthalmologist Dr. Manel Pasqual and Mrs. Sumithra Wickremasinghe, while also acknowledging the contribution of all other dedicated staff at the centre.ICEE, in collaboration with other international and local stakeholders, first commenced eye care services in Sri Lanka after the devastating Tsunami in 2004. During the early service delivery and training trips it soon became evident that many Sri Lankans had never had an eye examination which is thought to be linked to the shortage and distribution of eye care services, and the high cost of spectacles in Sri Lanka which is beyond the affordability of many in the community.Since the Kadawatha Vision Centre opened its doors, 9907 free eye examinations have been conducted and 4674 spectacles have been provided to those in need and presently, the ICEE has four other Vision Centres in Sri Lanka.About ICEE: International Centre for Eyecare Education (ICEE pronounced I See) is a global non-profit, non-governmental organisation. In the last ten years ICEE has delivered sustainable eye care services, education and training programmes in more than 40 countries. ICEE is focused on the elimination of avoidable blindness by developing solutions with communities in need of eye care, thereby improving opportunities in education, employment and quality of life. ICEE is supported by the Brien Holden Vision Institute and Optometry Giving Sight. For more info, visit our website: www.icee.orgPhoto captions: From left  Ms. A. Munasinghe, ICEE Sri Lanka, Lion M.

211,"The government has instituted a unique opportunity to facilitate professional education tailored to the demands of the job market for the students who have faced G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, regardless of their results.Saman Rubasinghe, the Director of Registration Accreditation and Quality Management at the Tertiary Education and Vocational Education Commission, said the students can initiate the application process even prior to the release of examination results.He explained that this program spans across 525 schools island-wide. All candidates who have participated in the Ordinary Level examination are eligible to apply after the Vocational Training Institute issues the relevant newspaper advertisement. All courses are meticulously designed with a focus on the contemporary job market, he added.Speaking on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“101 KathaÃ¢â‚¬Â program produced by the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬Âs Media Division (PMD), Mr. Rubasinghe highlighted that vocational education is integrated into the school curriculum during the first year, followed by the conferment of an NVQ level certificate in the second year through collaboration with a vocational training institute. Upon obtaining the NVQ 4 certificate, individuals have the opportunity to pursue further education at various levels, including diplomas, advanced diplomas and degrees.Under the conventional practice, the students who fail the Ordinary Level examination would typically be excluded from the education process. However, during the premiership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“13-year continuous education programÃ¢â‚¬Â was introduced, recognizing the need to direct students to vocational education through the school itself to prepare the student community to face future challenges.Mr. Rubasinghe, providing further insights, emphasized that through this program, all students who participated in the Ordinary Level examination have been offered the opportunity to pursue vocational education, regardless of their examination outcomes.Additionally, individuals preparing for Advanced Level examination and those aspiring to pursue professional education abroad often inquire about opportunities. In such cases, they can undertake short-term courses to acquire requisite language proficiency, he explained.Moreover, possessing computer knowledge is deemed highly beneficial across various fields, including motor mechanics, welding technology, agricultural assistance and the hotel industry. While it may not constitute a professional qualification, it holds significant importance as an additional qualification in enhancing overall skills.Furthermore, there are individuals who make a conscious choice to pursue vocational education, irrespective of whether they have successfully passed the Ordinary Level examination. Dedicated vocational education programs have been initiated for such individuals across 525 schools in Sri Lanka. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“13-year continuous education programÃ¢â‚¬Â facilitates the pursuit of vocational education directly from school, allowing individuals to proactively engage in skill development.Meanwhile, notifications for applications will be communicated through newspaper advertisements, ensuring widespread awareness of the opportunities available.The professional courses offered are meticulously designed to align with the demands of the job market. In the initial year of the two-year higher education program in the vocational field, vocational education is imparted within the school. Subsequently, students transition to a registered Vocational Training Centre for the remainder of the program.The culmination of this educational journey results in the attainment of the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificate.Over the past 5-6 years, this program has successfully cultivated and produced highly skilled professionals, contributing to its increased popularity among students. The programÃ¢â‚¬Âs ability to consistently produce talented individuals underscores its effectiveness in meeting industry needs and preparing students for successful careers in their chosen vocational fields.Upon successful completion of the program, individuals receive NVQ 3 and NVQ 4 certificates. Subsequently, they have the option to pursue further studies, including diplomas, advanced diplomas and degrees, offered by UNIVOTEC. Those achieving an NVQ 6 certificate gain eligibility to apply for degree courses abroad. This comprehensive educational framework spans across 26 fields, encompassing areas such as motor engineering, welding, agriculture and the hotel industry.For individuals opting for vocational training after completing high school, there is a wealth of opportunities available through the 1400 private and public institutions registered with the Tertiary and Vocational Training Commission.Further information can be accessed through the official website http://www.tvec.gov.lk.

His contribution to the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youth by founding the National Youth Service Council in 1979 deserves to be remembered.The two main institutions under our Ministry are the National Youth Service Council and the National Youth Corps. Every Regional Secretariat of this nation has a youth service officer assigned to them under the National Youth Service Council to handle youth-related issues.The National Youth Corps is a program that has been put in place to enhance the talents of young people in this country who have left school between the ages of 18 and 29 in order to create a perfect youth generation with abilities. They are also given knowledge of various languages including Korean and Japanese.Also, in the recent past, various issues have arisen due to political interference in the selection of athletes for international competitions. Therefore, it must be said that the step taken to appoint the National Sports Council is a very important one.The National Sports Council consists of veteran athletes like Arjuna Ranatunga and Susanthika Jayasinghe, who are experienced sports personalities who have an understanding of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sports. It has paved the opportunity to make relevant selections through appropriate levels in getting athletes to participate in international competitions. Therefore, today no one can make accusations about political interference in these affairs.66 of the 72 sports federations in this country are currently in operation.

216,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that an Economic Commission will be formed as early as possible to approve investment opportunity in order to provide more opportunities to local and foreign investors.The President also stated that it has the potential to significantly boost the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy.President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks today at the opening of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first migratory bird park and eco-tourism zone in Hanthane, Kandy (Feb. 20).President Wickremesinghe further said:Ã¢â‚¬Å“I remembered another bird park when I arrived here. President J.R. Jayawardene established the parliament on the bird park that was constructed during the reign of King Parakramabahu VI. There are now various types of birds, as well as crows.Mr. Kottegoda spoke about the 20 years of hardship that went into building this bird park. However, Mr. Kottegoda has bestowed the country an International Bird Park today. According to him, this international practice was inspired by SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jurong Bird Park. SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jurong City was created as an investment zone.More investment opportunities are necessary for Sri Lanka to embark on a new economic path. It takes ten years to approve a firm after an investor arrives in Sri Lanka. This situation should be changed. Production, export economy and technical sectors should be developed under a new economic plan. More chances for domestic and international investment should be provided for that.The economy wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t grow if it takes a foreign investor ten years to arrive and begin investing in Sri Lanka. President J.R. Jayawardena passed the Greater Colombo Economic Plan in a short period of three months and Sri Lanka got its economic benefits. President Premadasa approved the 200 garment industries program in three weeks. In this way, if the investment opportunities are not increased, it is not possible to strengthen the economy of Sri Lanka.Instead of the Board of Investment and the Board of Exports, we should appoint an Economic Commission and come to a system of giving approval for investments through one agency. Minister Dilum Amunugama has been assigned to arrange that. The report will be available within the next two to three weeks. Accordingly, we hope to implement it in the future. I would like to thank you for donating this bird park to the nation by providing value to the tourists.Ã¢â‚¬ÂChairman of the Migratory Bird Park and Ecotourism Zone Mr. Nishantha Kottegoda said:Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is also a unit to treat and release injured birds in the park, which consists of birds native to foreign countries, migratory birds, etc. The park also has a unit for breeding and exporting exotic birds, an educational and recreational centre for school students and a study of natural birds.This project was started under the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yali Pubudamu Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬Â program. The first phase could be completed this year amid various obstacles from the government officials. To move this project forward, the government officials asked for a super luxury bus that could run in Colombo as a bribe. This project had to be stopped many years ago because it could not be provided. Anyway, we have been able to declare open the first phase today.Ã¢â‚¬ÂAdjacent to the Hantane Tea Museum premises, this 27-acre exotic bird park and eco-tourism zone is home to over a hundred species of migratory birds.Established at a cost of Rs. 490 million, exotic birds are housed in large cages and the animals are cared for by a group of nearly one hundred workers.This park has been established based on a study of birds that are not native to Sri Lanka for a period of 40 years. It is also special that many exotic birds can be bred in this country.In the first phase of the Bird Park and eco-tourism zone, facilities for local and foreign tourists to see migratory birds, an educational training centre for zoology students, a bird orphanage, a bird home and a quarantine unit has been established.State Ministers Dilum Amunugama, Lohan Ratwatte, Anuradha Jayaratne, Member of Parliament Nalaka Kottegoda, PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Senior Advisor on National Security and PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Central Province Governor Lalith U.

Samantha Power, thank you very much for your time. So much has changed in Sri Lanka since your last visit, what do you observe here? And what brings you at this juncture?ADMINISTRATOR POWER: Well normally, I visit Sri Lanka, or in the past, I have visited in circumstances where there have been political fights about this or that. There have been economic challenges for sure, over the years. Obviously, issues related to human rights violations associated with the conflicts that brought me to Sri Lanka when I was President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Human Rights Adviser, when I was UN Ambassador, but unfortunately, this trip really is motivated by the gravity of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic crisis. And the privilege that I have in running USAID, of being able to open up the toolbox and say, okay with our resources, which are finite, but what can we do to support the people of this country at this really, really vulnerable time? And, you know, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a particularly difficult time, because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sort of, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the end of the beginning. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moving out of one phase into a new set of economic reforms, political reforms as well, which need to accompany the economic. And this is where people are already tired. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already spent months, maybe out on the streets, some of them, involved in protests, but almost everybody having some period where they were walking or riding bicycles, where they had been accustomed to taking buses or driving themselves. And, this is a period where thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still great sacrifice that lies ahead in order for the country to get back on a more stable economic footing. And so, President Biden asked me to come and to see up close what more the United States can do, and we have come and have identified fertilizer for farmers as one area where Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with the infusion of $40 million in support for fertilizer and other agricultural and necessities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we can try to help the farmers that are hoping to have a better yield in this next planting season than they have in the one that just passed. And so, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very important, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an acute humanitarian need of the kind that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not accustomed to seeing in this country, except in a time of conflict. And that is, where we have parents who just literally wake up in the morning, or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to bed at night, because all they can think about is how am I going to feed my kids. And so, today I announced an additional $20 million in emergency humanitarian support, to try to help mothers be able to feed their families and meet those emergency needs for the most vulnerable for that sector, that right now, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being reached with state assistance, and that havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been able to identify any other means, really, in keeping families afloat. So, those are just two ways of trying to chip in. Also, to remind Sri Lankans, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an awful lot of solidarity out there with them. The crisis here has generated global headlines, there is a lot of soul searching and a lot of questions in other countries about how we can avoid those scenarios for ourselves. So, others are learning, unfortunately, the hard lessons that Sri Lanka is learning as well. But, I think that this is a time where if we could combine more global solidarity with the Sri Lankan people with domestic solidarity, where political divisions can give way to some unity to get through this Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this really difficult time and get these reforms on track. Then, one can see Sri Lanka getting to the other side.AMUWATTE: Your visit to Sri Lanka comes following the IMF staff level agreement that Colombo reached recently. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve met the Sri Lankan President today, and the assistance youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve pledged to, in addition to $40 million U.S. dollars yesterday, also comes on top of USAIDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assistance pledge in June. But in terms of reforms, what have you discussed with the President? And what more should Sri Lanka do, today, in order to overcome the economic challenges that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about?ADMINISTRATOR POWER: Well, I think the President has made clear his intention of moving forward with a set of reforms that were agreed to with the IMF. And I think, the focus now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on his part and on the part of his team Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is also staffing up to be in a position to execute those reforms, very, very challenging, none of them are easy.I know that had I come even a month ago, I would have seen a very different picture in terms of the queues at the petrol stations. I met mothers today, in fact, who had to bring their kids with them to line up because, of course, they have no childcare for their kids. And so, you have kids sleeping at petrol stations for days on end. So, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to tell you, even seeing the QR code and the organization now, the fuel rationing policy that at least decreases the sense of chaos as well, that maybe Sri Lankans felt, but also outside investors who want to attract tourists and others. So, kind of tactical reforms like that, these deeper economic structural reforms we discussed. And then, we stressed, the industrial general and myself, the critical importance of keeping the political and governance reform agenda on center stage as well. And, this is very, very difficult, because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so many things that need doing, there is so much to clean up. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much to recover from. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much mobilization of debt restructuring or external resource mobilization that is needed, that it can be tempting to just focus on the economic.But, I know from talking with the private sector, both here and internationally, that investors are also looking for political stability. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to see the anti-corruption reforms moving forward. There are still, as you know, years of questions about transitional justice, and previous human rights violations, to start to see progress in those areas. The Prevention of the Terrorism Act, every visit I have made here for almost 15 years, has involved the discussion, with one of the previous Administrations, about the Prevention of Terrorism Act Ã¢â‚¬â€œ finally getting that repealed, as the President has committed to doing and putting, again, the country on a more stable, legal foundation that is more in accordance with international standards. We talked about all of that, but that is a very big agenda. And making sure that, again, as the government now gets constituted, and as the ministries get filled out, and as responsibilities get allocated, we at USAID, are looking to see where we can provide the technical support and technical capacity. And on these priority reforms, that the President and the people, are hoping will unlock more of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic potential.AMUWATTE: You just spoke about human rights, and we are also speaking at a time when Sri Lanka is preparing to face the Geneva Sessions, and there is concern raised about economic crimes on top of violations against human rights. At the same time, in Sri Lanka there is concern, and there are questions, why Sri Lanka is not allowed to do what Sri Lanka can, to allow Sri Lanka to be able to present with what Sri Lanka can without our own means? How do you react to this?ADMINISTRATOR POWER: Well, I think maybe stepping back from Sri Lanka, you know, the reason that when the United Nations was founded, Eleanor Roosevelt and a team of international specialists from all around the world, came together and crafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was the core recognition that, after the Second World War, especially, that governments canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always be trusted to respect the rights of their people, and that the people in society sometimes need to be able to have recourse to universal rights, that they may not be able to enjoy their own societies. And so, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how international law came into existence. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we have a United Nations. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we have a United Nations Human Rights Council. And the goal of these instruments and the goal of these bodies is not to meddle in somebody elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s country or dictate what should be done. It is to say, here are the universal human rights. The people in this case who have suffered human rights violations, may not feel that they have power within their own society, but they can feel empowered by the knowledge that these international instruments exist, and that this is the same as, what happens, actually in the United States is when our national laws are not delivering, you will see people appealing.For example, for a long time, we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a right to health care and a lot of the debate about health care, people say, well, actually, in other countries, and in these international instruments, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a right to health care. So, how come we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have health insurance? And so, in countries around the world, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a set of standards against which we are all measured. And I think, our hope over many years, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been active in engaging, again, Sri Lankans of different governments, for a long time on accountability and transitional justice, the hope has always been that the momentum for looking into past allegations of human rights violations, the momentum for tracking down missing persons, and giving families whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost loved ones closure, that momentum would come from within and it has. There would never have been a Human Rights Council resolution in the first place but for the anguish and pain of the families and the support of civil society, and some politicians, in order to help justice be done. But every time something is set up here, it seems like something else gets in the way of the kind of implementation or the kind of follow through that those families have been seeking for a long time. So to be clear, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very much within Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sovereign control to shape the form of transitional justice that takes hold here, and what the Human Rights Council offers is a whole host of technical expertise about how transitional justice has been managed in other settings. And our hope, at some point, is that that would be seen as a resource. And it has been, at different times. There have been periods where it really looked like, for example, the Office of Missing Persons was going to get traction and resources. There have been times when it looked like a truth commission really would be set up and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be some momentum behind it. And certainly the new Administration has made promises in those directions. And so, in Geneva, again, there are the standards, the sort of Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the keeper of the Human Rights flame, is the Human Rights Council, and then there is the expertise for when there is the kind of political will that is needed to meet the aspirations of people who underwent that violence.AMUWATTE: In 2015, you did mention of this progress made. But right now, as the U.S. Treasury also announced that they will support Sri Lanka to restructure debt and discuss with potential creditors who will potentially help Sri Lanka come out of this situation. What effort will USAID put into this? Again, another question along with that is there has been a lot of skepticism about U.S. funding in Sri Lanka, whether there are any strings attached to it. So, will there be any strings attached going forward?ADMINISTRATOR POWER: I think a distinguishing feature of U.S. assistance in Sri Lanka is that we really look to see how our assistance can empower our partners, Sri Lankans on the ground. And I can say just from meeting with the farmers yesterday to whom weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re providing the fertilizer, our goal is for them to have bigger yields in the next rice planting and harvesting season, full stop. Our goal is not for them to have bigger yields so that we can take a cut of the yields, or so that we can then say hey, we gave you that fertilizer money now you better do this for us. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really not the American approach. And, I think that when you talk about debt and USAID, I think what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re focused on now, because we work at the grassroots level, or try to, is there are a lot of Sri Lankans now who are carrying debt that, had the economy continue to function as it had in years past Ã¢â‚¬â€œ maybe not perfectly, but nonetheless, functionally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they would have been able to, for example, produce the kinds of crop that would allow them to pay back the people that they borrowed in order to buy the fertilizer in order to be able to plant and nourish the crop in the first place. But now with the economic collapse, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not clear how a lot of Sri Lankans are going to be able to repay their debt. And so, one of the things that we are looking at as USAID, is at the micro level Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with small farmers, with 10 farmers, with people who borrow just to be able to pay school fees to get their kids to school Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what can we do in support of those families.But additionally, since itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredibly important that the Sri Lankan government be providing the support to the most vulnerable, and certainly we heard from the President today, an intention to address food security and malnutrition in the most vulnerable but we can help with program design, drawing on other social safety net programs that we have supported in other parts of the world. Again, even though the civil service is very large in Sri Lanka, making sure that there is the human capacity to implement these programs, and to do so in a way where the intended beneficiaries are reached. And where assistance is not deployed, because of some political favor, out of some political preference, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deployed on the basis of need. That is how we try to operate as USAID. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not saying that we have been perfect over the years in Sri Lanka or in any other country. But, we are always on the ground trying to listen and learn and think about, if a program is not producing its desired effects, how do we adjust it? If, and this is true now, if we designed a program before the economic crisis, how do we now need to think about adjusting the programming because circumstances, as you said, have changed so much? But, our goal at USAID is for there to be no USAID in Sri Lanka. Because nobody wants assistance or handouts, really, they may need them, and so they want them in the sense that they need some support to feed their families in a crisis. But what every individual that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve met in my travels around the world, and here, wants is sovereignty, self-sufficiency, dignity. And I think, the ethos of USAIDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s programming is to think through how can we use our limited resources to catalyze that kind of economic growth, those kinds of economic opportunities, where the next planting season, farmers get themselves back in the cycle that they have been in before, of being able to buy the same supply, the same fertilizer to get the yield and to make the progress they need to make.AMUWATTE: And finally, the China factor has been a massive concern for the U.S. and India as well, speaking about sustainability, or even when we talk about Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reliance on it. So, how concerned are you now, after your conversations with Sri Lankan parties, and also in terms of IMF negotiations going forward, especially in terms of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic stability and security?ADMINISTRATOR POWER: Well, I think all players in the international system should wish to see countries becoming more independent and not more dependent. And so, again, I think that is a really important pillar of the approach that President Biden is taking, as we think about what support we can offer, how does it enhance independence rather than dependence? Debt, unfortunately, is a form of dependence, because you are reliant on the people from whom you have borrowed. In moments like this, especially when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not able to pay back your debt in the near term, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reliant on them making adjustments, and being persuadable. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a good feeling. For any of us whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve incurred debt in our private lives, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly not a good feeling for a nation that finds itself suffering significant debt distress. So, we believe all countries have an opportunity to stand with Sri Lanka at this vulnerable moment. And we believe that Sri Lankans will remember, probably for generations, those of us who are creditors. The U.S. is a creditor, as well, and a member of the Paris Club. Were we willing to roll up our sleeves and work with Sri Lanka in helping support the country on its road out of this crisis? And we would hope that the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Republic of China and that all other creditors would do the same, putting the interests of this wonderful country, and the people of this wonderful country, who are incredibly dynamic, incredibly resilient, incredibly capable of advancing their own economic interests, but where there has been a lot of mismanagement, a lot of corruption, some very poor decisions made over many, many years, but to unlock the potential of those people, those of us who have leverage and have an opportunity to offer support, we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t conceive of why a country wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t step forward and show that solidarity, at this hour of such great need.AMUWATTE: In your understanding, how far has Sri Lanka come in solving this issue? And especially with the IMF, and in terms of negotiations, potential negotiations with the creditors? What more do we need to do?ADMINISTRATOR POWER: Well, I mean, I do think that it is important to acknowledge that, first of all, the staff level agreement with the IMF needs to translate into a full fledge agreement, but when that agreement is secured, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually when a lot of the hard work begins. Because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing to agree on a set of reforms, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another thing to implement those reforms, and to try to rationalize the economy, and balance the books, and get the export-import balance more right sized than it has been in the past. And so, there are going to be some very difficult sacrifices asked of the Sri Lankan people, and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how broad-based the understanding is that simply signing an agreement is just the beginning. That the agreement is actually just a piece of paper. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the reforms and cutting down on some of the more wasteful programs, but even wasteful programs have beneficiaries, and there are winners and they are losers. And so, I think, this is why it is so important to keep an eye on the legitimacy of the entire enterprise, and do everything, all authorities to do everything in their power, to be transparent and candid about the difficult choices ahead. I think, the President has tried to do that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to level with the Sri Lankan people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but at every step of the way to be open about the sacrifices that are demanded, and at every step of the way, I hope for countries like the United States, to again, be standing with the Sri Lankan people, because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to feel lonely, as those tough economic reforms kick in. And that show of solidarity from the outside world I hope will be a source of resources in some cases, but also a source of hope that there is light on the other side.MS.

222,"Power sector officials today (November 03) pointed out that as the Yugadanavi project is a great investment opportunity for the country, it is necessary to consider the long-term benefits while forgetting the short-term issues in order to take advantage fromthis investment.At present, more than 95% of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electricity demand is being catered and therefore, low-cost power plants need to be built to meet the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electricity needs, otherwise, the electricity tariff hike will be unavoidable, the officials further said.They pointed out that it has become an imperative factor that we should transform to intermediate energy sources with new concepts and new technology, as the LNG power generation is a low-cost, environmentally friendly method, the transformation that is to take place through the Yugadanavi power plant is a profitable project for the government as well as for the people of the country.This was stated by the relevant authorities in the power sector in response to questions raised by journalists at a special media briefing held at the Presidential Media Center, this afternoon.The PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Media Spokesman Kingsly Rathnayaka conducted todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s media briefing under the theme Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Truth about the Yugadanavi ProjectÃ¢â‚¬Â.The daily electricity demand is increasing rapidly. The production cost per unit of electricity has increased to Rs. 23 - 24. However, the government provides electricity to consumers at Rs. 16.65 per unit, said the Chairman of the Electricity Board, Mr. M.C. Ferdinando.The Chairman further said that the country had lost many power generation projects that had been under discussion for a long time due to various reasons and it is vital to increase power generation to ensure uninterrupted power supply.The success of the Yugadanavi investment project will enable both local and foreign industrialists to consume electricity at a lower cost, Chairman of the Lanka Electricity Company Attorney-at-Law Athula De Silva said.Electricity Board General Manager M. R. Ranatunga pointed out that 40,000 million units of electricity are required per year to fulfil the total electricity consumption and only by generating this amount at a lower cost, the people will have the opportunity to obtain electricity at concessionary rates.When asked whether the trade union leaders have held discussions with the authorities on the current situation at the Yugadanavi power plant, Mr. Ranatunga said that no trade union has made a request for a discussion. He also said the authorities are ready to explain the technical process and benefits of the Yugadanavi project.Responding to a question from a journalist on whether there is a possibility of power cuts in the future, the General Manager said the statements made by some groups to mislead the public should be ignored and that many trade unions have expressed support to provide an uninterrupted power supply.Additional Secretary of the Power Ministry Dr. Susantha Perera also participated in the media briefing.-PMD",OTHER,OTHER,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=78153,3,,Other Ethnic groups,News
223,"Professor of Community Health at the Medical Faculty of the University of Colombo, Manju Weerasinghe urged the youth not to be misled by the baseless opinions expressed by certain persons with commercial interests, and to take the vaccines against the COVID-19 virus at the first available opportunity.The Professor points out that there is no scientific basis to the statements made by certain persons that sexual impotence and infertility are caused in the human body due to the vaccine. He urged the youth not to fall prey to such false opinions and act wisely, protect themselves and the country as well.Professor Weerasinghe was speaking at a media briefing organized by the Government Information Department to respond with scientific facts to the fallacies being circulated through various platforms, which it says are intended to disrupt the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination program.The death toll on persons over 60 has reduced due to vaccination. Professor Weerasinghe called on the propagandists who circulate false opinions with ulterior motives not to disrupt the current vaccination program that intends to save the lives of the youth.The second jab of the vaccine was given to nearly 12 million citizens by September 26. Another 2.2 million are waiting for the Second dose. The best solution, not only in Sri Lanka but also in the world to control the COVID-19 pandemic is vaccination, he said.According to Professor Weerasinghe, the first legislation on vaccination against communicable diseases was brought by Parliament of Great Britain in 1853. That was to control Smallpox. Since then, the factions who oppose vaccination have one reasoning that it is futile, might contain unhealthy substances therefore, countries should not accept the command of Western Medicine. Vaccines were introduced against Rabies in 1885, Diphtheria in 1920. Several vaccines were introduced between 1949 and 1955 as well. Therefore, vaccination has been proved the most effective treatment and decisive factor as it has been able to control several contagious diseases to the minimum level possible.Addressing journalists, consultant physician attached to the Homagama COVID-19 Treatment Tertiary Hospital Dr. Eranga Narangoda said vaccination helped reduce the number of COVID-19 related deaths and infected patients as well.Complete immunization is developed in the human body two months after the vaccination of both doses. When tested positive for the disease during this pending period, the condition of even a vaccinated patient could become serious or the patient could die.The Doctor refuted the public opinion that immunity generation differs from one brand to other. He said all 08 vaccines recommended by WHO have an equal capacity of immunization. Pfizer has been recommended for children between 12 to 18 and all others over 18 would get immunization from any variety of COVID vaccines.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has recorded the least child-death rate in the South Asian region because children are vaccinated in prescribed time, said Director of the Family Health Bureau, Community Health Specialist Dr. Chithramali de Silva. She said child vaccination began in 1961 but it was extended island-wide in 1978. The Child-death rate could be reduced by examining the health of children intermittently and giving them relevant jabs.

249,"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says that even though a local government election is not an election at which political power changes hands, this election is of special significance because it is the first time people will have an opportunity to use the ballot to demonstrate their opposition to the present government.Issuing a statement regarding the upcoming LG polls, he said that the only election held previously under yahapalana government was the parliamentary election of August 2015.He charged that the president ensured the victory of the UNP at that election through Ã¢â‚¬Å“stratagemsÃ¢â‚¬Â such as issuing public statements to destablise the UPFA election campaign and by sacking the general secretaries of the SLFP and the UPFA on the eve of the poll.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thereby the message that was conveyed to the whole country was that since it is the President who calls the shots, the UNP will ultimately end up triumphant even if they lose the election.Ã¢â‚¬ÂRajapaksa said this is why the Joint Opposition is contesting this local government election under a different symbol and a different political alliance.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The objective of the Joint Opposition is to provide all those opposed to this government with a political alternative.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe Kurunegala District MP claimed that even though the JVP masquerades as an opposition party, Ã¢â‚¬Å“they are an integral part of the yahapalana collective.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe charged that under todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership, the JVP has become Ã¢â‚¬Å“a catÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paw of the UNP.Ã¢â‚¬Â Therefore, the voting public should be mindful of the fact that the only real opposition to this government is the Joint Opposition, Rajapaksa said.He further said that the local government election that is to be held in February 2018 will be the first of a series of elections running up to the next presidential election.He says that the next presidential election process will have to begin by October 2019 and hence there will only be around 18 months between the local government elections and the beginning of the next Presidential elections process in 2019.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Therefore, we can expect the local government election in February 2018 to be the first in a series of elections with the provincial council elections being held next, to be followed some months later, by the presidential election.Ã¢â‚¬ÂRajapaksa said that the people are only too well aware of the fate that has befallen the country after the UNP-SLFP coalition government took office.Ã¢â‚¬Å“In a situation where this coalition government has demonstrated in unmistakable terms that they are incapable of running the country, every voter should ask themselves whether there is any sense in the same people asking for a mandatetorun the local government authorities as well.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe urged the voting public to set aside all other considerations and to cast their vote at the forthcoming local government elections solely on the basis of being either in favour of, or opposed to, the present UNP-SLFP coalition government.",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=44791,1,,Other Ethnic groups,News

252,"The views of US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May on matters of national security offer a Ã¢â‚¬Å“window of opportunityÃ¢â‚¬Â to the Sri Lankan government to re-negotiate the September 2015 UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution on it, says Dr.Dayan Jayatilleka, former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UN in Geneva and France. He said the UNHRC resolution, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka at the instance of the US and other Western powers, has tied down the island nation to steps which could demoralize its Security Forces and compromise national security. It ought to be re-negotiated in the light of the latest thinking in Washington and London, Jayatilleka told Express on Thursday.Security conscious Trump had assured the Afghan President in December 2016 that he would increase US troops in that country which is being harassed by the Taliban. Currently there are about 8,400 US troops apart from 6,400 from its allies.Recently, Trump had said that he would build a wall to stop illegal immigration from Mexico, and that in investigations of suspected terrorists, Ã¢â‚¬Å“torture works absolutelyÃ¢â‚¬Â and that the US must Ã¢â‚¬Å“fight fire with fireÃ¢â‚¬Â.British Prime Minister Theresa May had said in September last year, that her government will not allow British soldiers who had served in Iraq to be dragged to the courts on human rights violation charges and that she would protect servicemen from legal harassment.With such views emanating from Western capitals, which were behind the UNHC resolution in 2015 September, Sri Lanka should press for re-negotiation of the resolution to accord with its national security imperatives, Jayatilleka urged.He regretted that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“pro-WestÃ¢â‚¬Â Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are not seizing the opportunity.Jayatilleka warned that given the growing clout of the nationalist forces in Sri Lankan politics, the United National Party (UNP) - dominated government would find it more and more difficult to implement the key clauses of the UNHRC resolution. Any move to ram the unpleasant clauses down the throats of the nationalist masses would only erode the standing of the government, he said.The former diplomat noted that President Maithripala Sirisena, who is more sensitive to the ground situation in Sri Lanka than the UNP leadership, has shown a manifest interest in protecting the dignity of the Sri Lankan Security Forces.According to Jayatilleka, Sirisena has also sensed the possibility of working with a reoriented US Administration under President Trump. In this context he said it is significant that Sirisena has nominated Susil Premajayantha, a stalwart of his nationalistic Sri Lanka Freedom Party, to represent Sri Lanka at President TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prayer Breakfast.Source: The New Indian Express-Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=38815,6,,Other Ethnic groups,News

Ã¢â‚¬Å“We welcome, however, the commitments made by the new Government of Sri Lanka to embark on comprehensive measures to ensure truth, justice and reparation for victims, as well as prevent any recurrence of disappearances in the futureÃ¢â‚¬Â, indicated the experts.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Finally there is a positive environment to seriously address these issues,Ã¢â‚¬Â the experts said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We note encouraging steps such as the official invitation for the Working Group to visit the country, the excellent cooperation received during the visit and the GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increasing opennessÃ¢â‚¬Â, they added. The Working Group also highlighted the commitments expressed by various authorities they met, including to establish a dedicated Office for Missing Persons and to carry out broad consultations on future measures to be taken.Ã¢â‚¬Å“These promises and commitments must now be followed by concrete efforts and tangible results,Ã¢â‚¬Â they emphasized. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is the only way to regain the trust of victims for past failures to address their rights. The Government will need to adopt bold steps to reach out to and create confidence in the victims.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sri Lanka must seize this historic opportunity and adopt urgent and profound measures to satisfy the rights of the victims as a fundamental step which will help lay the ground for a sincere reconciliation process,Ã¢â‚¬Â they said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reconciliation, however - while extremely necessary in Sri Lanka - cannot be achieved at the expense of the rights of the victims.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe experts expressed support for the recommendation made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in his recent Human Rights Council report to integrate international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators into the envisaged judicial mechanism aimed at prosecuting massive human rights and humanitarian law violations - including enforced disappearances.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Working Group also supports the establishment of the Office for Missing Persons dedicated to the humanitarian task of searching for the thousands of disappeared in the country,Ã¢â‚¬Â stated the experts. The Working Group noted that this body should act in a non-discriminatory, impartial, independent and professional manner, adopting a victim-centred approach. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Office should look at all enforced disappearances, regardless of the time and place of their occurrence, and regardless of the perpetrator,Ã¢â‚¬Â the experts said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The same principles should guide the activities of the proposed Truth CommissionÃ¢â‚¬Â.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The design and implementation of all these measures - which should be parallel and go hand in hand - call for truly inclusive, good faith, consultative, gender-sensitive and participatory methods,Ã¢â‚¬Â the experts noted. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is of outmost importance to genuinely include families of disappeared and the organizations representing them in the consultation processÃ¢â‚¬Â.As one first measure, the experts urge the authorities to give clear instructions at all level of the military, security and law-enforcement forces that all type of threats, harassment and intimidation towards families searching for their loved ones must immediately cease, will not be tolerated and will be severely sanctioned.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some of the persons with whom we met have been questioned in relation to our visit. This is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic societyÃ¢â‚¬Â they said Ã¢â‚¬Å“Building trust and confidence among the victims will not be possible without seriously addressing this crucial issueÃ¢â‚¬Â.The experts also called for the creation of an adequate legal and institutional framework to prevent enforced disappearances to occur again in the future, and ensure its adequate implementation.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some of these measures can be taken swiftly, among which: the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; the introduction of an autonomous crime of enforced disappearance in the penal code; the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act - which contains provisions that can facilitate the occurrence of enforced disappearances; and a thorough and independent investigation into all allegations of instances of secret detentionÃ¢â‚¬Â, noted the experts.During the ten-day visit, the Working GroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delegation visited - in addition to Colombo - Batticaloa, Galle, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Matale, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee.

(We have) deep appreciation and gratitude to you for having done so much in the way of national reconciliation.Prime Minister Shinzo Abes arrival in Sri Lanka on Sept. 7 will set a record for foreign nations visited by a Japanese leader. Japans premier was due today to arrive in Dhaka for a three-day visit to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka aimed at offsetting Chinas mounting influence in South Asia.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was to meet his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina today in Dhaka and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse tomorrow in Colombo to boost economic and security ties.Speaking to reporters before leaving Tokyo, Abe noted he was the first Japanese premier to visit Bangladesh in 14 years and Sri Lanka in 24 years.He called Bangladesh and Sri Lanka countries with a growing influence in economic and political domains.I hope to introduce the dynamism of both countries to Japans economy by strengthening relations with them and engaging in top-level sales activities, said Abe, who is accompanied by 50 top Japanese corporate executives.Abes grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, visited Sri Lanka as prime minister in 1957 when it was known as Ceylon.Both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are important bases along the sea lanes that link Japan with the Middle East. The two nations have long had friendly ties with Japan, but China in recent years has increased its presence with support for the construction of ports.Such social infrastructure has formed Chinas so-called String of Pearls through the Indian Ocean. Japan has expressed concerns that this arrangement could affect the sea lanes though which the country imports much of its petroleum.Abes visits to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are intended to heighten Japans presence in South Asia and serve as an attempt to drive a stake into the String of Pearls.During his meeting with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Abe is expected to offer coast guard cutters to help Sri Lanka strengthen its maritime patrol activities.

264,"The United National Party (UNP) today said that by refusing to engage with the team of investigators appointed by the UN Human Rights Commissioner, Sri Lanka is admitting guilt and depriving itself of an opportunity to make its case.In a statement issued, the UNP accused the Rajapaksa regime of once again playing politics with the national question and toying with the grave threat that it is posing in the international arena. After the recent announcement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of the establishment of her team to investigate the atrocities committed by both parties to the Sri Lankan conflict, the government, in a blatant attempt to politicize the issue, has placed before parliament the question of whether the Government should allow the team to visit Sri Lanka or not, Sri Lankas main opposition party said.It stressed that the burning question before the country today is not the issuance of visas to a few foreigners. Whether they visit Sri Lanka or not, is not going to have any effect on whether the investigation would be held or not; this investigation will go ahead. What we should do and what the United National Party (UNP) has been stressing for many years is the necessity to prevent such international scrutiny into our affairs. It is beyond dispute that we are in this precarious plight today because of the egregious errors committed by and the lackadaisical inaction displayed by the ruling family cabal, the UNP said, in a strongly-worded statement.The international community, after offering the Sri Lankan government numerous opportunities to carry out a credible internal investigation into the alleged human rights violations, especially in relation to the final phase of the war, has determined that the Rajapaksa regime is neither willing nor capable of such action, it said.After being duped for years, the international wheels of justice have now begun to turn.The UNP said it has repeatedly asked the ruling regime to address these international challenges head-on. Rather than hiding behind a nationalist, jingoist propaganda veil, the Government should realize that there is a serious issue of human rights in this country.Its never too late. International challenges can still be effectively faced and resolved. What is required from the regime is the political will, the statement said. The party further said that the resolution passed in March this year at the Human Rights Council allows for a window of opportunity for the Sri Lankan government to carry out a credible internal investigation and it would prove that Sri Lanka is capable of handling its own issues. In the meantime, by blanket refusal to engage with the team of investigators appointed by the UN Human Rights Commissioner, Sri Lanka is admitting guilt and depriving itself of an opportunity to make its case. This would not only be an injustice to the valiant soldiers who sacrificed so much for this country but a betrayal of all our people who will have to suffer the consequences of international action, it said.The UNP called on the government to cooperate with the UNHRC as the mandate of the team also involves investigating the atrocities carried out by the LTTE. The Government should at least present to the investigators the crimes committed by the Tigers, it said. The UNP said it stands prepared to support the Government to restore the systems and institutions of democratic governance, provided it will pledge to restore the 17th Amendment and prioritize a return to civilized values and the rule of law.

269,"The JVP today charged that the governments continues violations of democracy and human rights, for the purpose of safeguarding its power, have created the opportunity for Western nations to interfere in Sri Lanka.The government violated democracy and human rights for its power, JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said, adding, that security forces opened fire in Rathupaswala, Chilaw and Katunayake not for the country but for the sake of Rajapaksa family and the familys power.He stated that even former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake was sacked for the Rajapaksa familys power and not for the country.He stated that the Sri Lanka Police are able to solve any controversial crime but the reason no arrests have been made regarding the numerous journalist murders and attacks on media organizations is due to the government.He claimed that the governments direct involvement in the murders of journalists including former Sunday Leader Lasantha Wickramatunga is the main reason that no arrests have been made regarding those cases.He stated that journalists were attacked and murdered, media organizations were torched not for the betterment of the country, but solely to protect the Rajapaksa familys power.The countrys democracy and human rights were completely violated for the power of the Rajapaksas, he told reporters in Colombo.Not just that, within the past 4 years over 1,200 university students have been suspended, 130 students have been arrested, over 125 have been assaulted and 20 have been robbed of their degrees, Dissanayake said.This oppression of university students is for the Rajapaksa governments attempt to destroy the countrys education, he alleged. The Rajapaksa administration controlled the country by violating democracy and human rights for their power.Especially in the Northern Province, the immediate establishing of democracy and human rights was required after the war, but still a semi-military control is prevailing in that region, the Parliamentarian said.He stated that a wedding ceremony or even funeral cannot be held at a residence in the North without the intervention of intelligence officers.    Instead of safeguarding the human rights of the people in the North, especially after the war, the government continues to violate their democracy and human rights, he claimed.These actions by the government has created the space for the western nations to interfere in Sri Lanka, he emphasized.Similar to opposing the inference by Western nations led by the United States, the public should also oppose the government for paving the path for these counties to interfere, he said.Anura Kumara further stated that at a time when Sri Lankas diplomatic service should be at its strongest, the President has appointed his relatives and stooges to the top diplomatic posts.Our country is facing the biggest threat from the US and therefore we should send the superman of the Foreign Service to take up the role of Sri Lankas ambassador to the US, he said.Today who is our ambassador in the US? Beliatte Jaliya. A tea leaves trader who took tea leaves from Deniyaya and sold it in the US. A relative of Mahinda Rajapksa. He stressed that instead of sending the most intelligent professionals from the Foreign Service to the major countries, the President has sent his brother-in-law to serve as Sri Lankas ambassador to Russia, a politician who lost the last provincial polls to Italy, a former Rupavahini corporation Chairman to Germany and so on.

271,"British Prime Minister David Cameron says he made it clear to President Mahinda Rajapaksa that he now has a real opportunity, through magnanimity and reform, to build a successful, inclusive and prosperous future for Sri Lanka by working in partnership with the newly elected Chief Minister of the Northern Province.I met the new provincial Chief Minister from the Tamil National Alliance, who was elected in a vote that happened only because of the spotlight of the Commonwealth meeting, he told the British House of Commons yesterday.He further stated that no one wants to return to the days of the Tamil Tigers and the disgusting and brutal things they did and that Britain should show proper respect for the fact that Sri Lanka suffered almost three decades of conflict and that recovery and reconciliation take time. But I made it clear to President Rajapaksa that he now has a real opportunity, through magnanimity and reform, to build a successful, inclusive and prosperous future for his country, working in partnership with the newly elected Chief Minister of the Northern Province, Cameron said. I very much hope that he seizes that opportunity.The British premier said he had a choice to stay away from the Commonwealth and allow President Rajapaksa to set the agenda he wanted, or to go and shape the agenda by advancing our interests with our Commonwealth partners and shining a spotlight on the international concerns about Sri Lanka.I chose to go and stand up for our values and to do all I could to advance them. I believe that that was the right decision for Sri Lanka, for the Commonwealth and for Britain, he said.Bitter exchanges erupted in the UK Parliament when British Prime Minister David Cameron delivered a statement on his attendance at the Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka.In a highly personal attack on the Labour leader, Ed Miliband who had urged the Prime Minister to join others and boycott the event, Cameron accused him of not knowing what he was talking about.If he knows anything about foreign affairs - and I doubt it, because he barely gets out of Islington... he said.Taunting Miliband further, he added that his brother David once said Britain needed a Foreign Secretary who could stop the traffic in Beijing, but the Opposition leader couldnt even get out of Primrose Hill (in the London Borough of Camden).He was painting one of those Tory pictures of Labour leaders as Islington luvvies - champagne socialists whose contact with the real world is limited to gossip amongst like-minded lefties around the dinner table. He even managed to get Len McClusky into it somehow.Unsurprisingly, Miliband looked baffled by the assault and its ferocity, but declined to deliver an attack on the residents of Cameron Counrty, otherwise known as the Chipping Norton in Costwolds.Cameron had made a good fist of explaining why it had been better to engage with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and shine the spotlight on the issue.When I met with President Rajapaksa, I pressed for credible, transparent and independent investigations into alleged war crimes. And I made clear to him that if these investigations are not begun properly by March then I will use our position on the UN Human Rights Council, to work with the UN Human Rights Commissioner and call for an international inquiry, he said.What clearly got under his skin, though, was what he believes was another bout of playing politics by Ed Miliband, who suggested the prime ministers visit had achieved nothing concrete.Miliband said Rajapaksa should not take over the chairmanship of the Commonwealth and declared: The legacy of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka is in contradiction to the good traditions of the Commonwealth.Later, the prime ministers spokesman confirmed that, in his role, Rajapaksa would be attending the Commonwealth games in Scotland next year.We will take the same approach as we have towards the Commonwealth summit which is that international events offer the opportunity to shine the spot light, he said.

274,"                   Canadas foreign minister says that despite his countrys efforts, the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) have failed to utilize its biennial summit as an opportunity to address long-concerns and to catalyze meaningful change for the people of Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth failed to put any pressure on a regime that has so blatantly ignored international calls for change, John Baird wrote, in an opinion article published by iPolitics. He stated that despite CMAGs enhanced mandate, which was based on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group and approval by heads of government, it refused to put Sri Lanka on the agenda to allow members an opportunity to discuss these shortcomings.We failed to use this when it mattered most. As a consequence, we gave this regime a free pass to continue down this path, he charged. He further stated that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harpers decision not to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Sri Lanka was based entirely on upholding the principles of the Commonwealth. This was not a decision taken in haste. It was carefully considered with one aim in mind: for Canada to send a message about our displeasure with an organization that has failed to stand up for its fundamental principles, Baird writes. He questions how an organization like the Commonwealth could reward a country like Sri Lanka, not just with hosting a summit, but by allowing it to chair the organization for two years? Baird says that it was Canadas sincere hope that the government of Sri Lanka would take the necessary steps to secure basic freedoms for all its people, yet the Rajapaksa regime continues to commit abhorrent human rights violations as it actively seeks to undermine the basic freedoms of democracy and the rule of law.The Canadian foreign minister further says that Sri Lankas authoritarian trend needs to be addressed and charged that the Commonwealth has refused to formally confront these reports, which he termed a complete abandonment of its founding principles and an obfuscation of its responsibilities.Harper remains the only leader to boycott the Colombo conference, and wont even send a cabinet-level representative. Parliamentary secretary Deepak Obhrai will represent Canada at the mid-November summit.Baird says that the purpose of Mr Obhrais attendance will be to enable Canada to partake in some events surrounding the summit which he says will allow Canada to shed light on the true tragedy in Sri Lanka.

They have been welcomed by your government and everybody in the system, so dont let this great country be spoiled by people like this.The call has provoked a mixed reaction from refugee advocates, with some arguing that the Boxing Day Test represents an opportunity to get information to a mass audience, and they plan to distribute leaflets attacking Sri Lankas treatment of Tamils to cricket fans.Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser has called for an independent assessment of the situation in Sri Lanka, including whether members of the Tamil minority are being persecuted and how those sent back from Australia after coming here by boat are being treated.If an inquiry found that Tamils were still being persecuted and if verifiable commitments were not given that this would stop, then the international community has got to take action, Mr Fraser told Fairfax Media.The Australian Tamil Congresss Bala Vigneswaren supported the boycott call, saying the Australian Cricket Board should apply the same standard to Sri Lanka that was applied to South Africa when that country was boycotted.The boycott call came as opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison announced that he and foreign affairs spokeswoman Julie Bishop would travel to Sri Lanka for meetings with government officials at the end of January.Well also go up and visit the Tamil areas in northern Sri Lanka and see things on the ground there, Mr Morrison told Sky News on Sunday.Mr Samarasinghe has previously dismissed claims of continued persecution of Sri Lankas Tamil minority, describing those who have attempted to come by boat as economic opportunists. Those talking of boycotts had a vested interest and should not be taken seriously, he said.The two groups defended their action.

But we fear that if nothing changes, the crimes that remain unaddressed will continue to haunt Sri Lankas people and could ignite violence once again.Finally we want to emphasise that Sri Lankas recent history is an issue that concerns all of us. Whether or not the Human Rights Council is able to summon the will to act on one of the most serious cases of human rights violations to have occurred since it was founded in 2006 could have ramifications for the global standing of human rights and international humanitarian law  and for the prestige and authority of the council.Read Full Article: This week the UN Human Rights Council has an opportunity and a duty to help Sri Lanka advance its own efforts on accountability and reconciliation. Both are essential if a lasting peace is to be achieved. In doing so, the council will not only be serving Sri Lanka, but those worldwide who believe there are universal rights and international legal obligations we all share.Nearly three years since the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) by the Sri Lankan government there has still been no serious domestic investigation of the many allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both sides during the civil wars final stages. These tragic events cannot simply be ignored.A report in April 2011 by a panel of experts appointed by the UN secretary general documented government forces large-scale shelling in no-fire zones where civilians had been encouraged to gather. Government forces also shelled a UN hub and food distribution lines. The same report says the LTTE used civilians as human shields, refused to allow people to leave conflict areas and forcibly recruited adults and children as young as 14 to fight. Credible sources cited in the UN report have estimated that around 40,000 civilians may have perished in the final months of the conflict.This tremendous civilian toll covers thousands of stories of suffering and strength, the vast majority of which are untold. One verified story chronicles the experiences of a family who were forcibly displaced more than seven times in eight months between September 2008 and May 2009. They repeatedly sought shelter in government-declared safe zones (which were then shelled), buried five relatives, including a six-year-old girl, in unmarked graves, and saw many of their fellow civilians killed and injured.While the Sri Lankan governments own report from its Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission, published last December, includes important findings on reconciliation, and represents a potentially useful opportunity to begin a national dialogue on the conflict, it is disappointing in its failure to address seriously accountability issues. The recent announcement that the army intends to investigate its own actions during the conflict is not the kind of independent inquiry that is required.In the absence of a credible and independent investigation into what happened in Sri Lanka, the Human Rights Council has an obligation to uphold human rights law and international humanitarian law during its upcoming 2012 sessions. As the UN report said: The conduct of the war by both sides represented a grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during both war and peace. The victory of one side has emboldened some to believe that these rules may now be disregarded in the cause of fighting terrorism.Against this background, and continuing reports of human rights violations by the authorities, we urge the council to support a resolution that seeks accountability for the terrible violations of international law that have taken place, and establishes mechanisms to monitor progress on the steps the government is taking on accountability. If there is insufficient progress by the government in establishing a credible accountability process in the near future, we urge council members to support the establishment of an independent investigation.At the same time, the council should support efforts to achieve meaningful reconciliation, human rights and democratic freedom for all Sri Lankans.

292,"Cashing in on a vibrant mobile phone market, PC House PLC (PCH) will soon be partnering one of Indias fastest growing mobile phone brands, Karbonn. Given its island-wide reach via an excellent distribution network, PCH believes it has the opportunity to market this brand at attractive price points.Mr. S.H.M. Rishan, Chairman of PCH says, We are in the process of planning a viable distribution network along with an attractive range of handsets with multiple features at competitive prices in order to successfully penetrate the local mobile phone market. Strong marketing and branding initiatives together with a service network matched to fight the big players are planned. In order to do this, PCH and Karbonn have earmarked a significant investment for the current financial year. The idea is to gain a significant market share in the next two years, similar to what PCH enjoys with all our other partners.Sri Lankas mobile subscribers grew to 15.86 million in the second quarter of 2010 up from 11.49 million a year earlier. The market is growing at around 20% to 25%, and there is room for Indian brands who offer the design and feel of the big brands within a price range of Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 14,000. Whilst inferior phone models with dual SIM options have been popularized in Sri Lanka lately, PCH is responding to huge customer demand for dual SIM phones backed by a proper warranty.Dual SIM phones are gaining popularity in the rural market, which is the next frontier for mobile telephony, due to better connectivity at an affordable price. For the upper end of the market, this capability has numerous attractions, such as having different numbers for different purposes, and for use when overseas, where a local SIM can take care of outgoing calls and the roaming capability of the other SIM could be used for receiving calls.Karbonn Mobiles is a joint venture between Delhi-based Jaina Group and Bangalore-based UTL Group. Jaina Group started out as a distributor of mobile handsets around 15 years ago. Though it now has its own brand in the market place, it is also the distributor of HTC in not just India but the whole of South Asia, and of Motorola and LG in India. Having launched in India last April, Karbonn now sells between 500,000 and 600,000 handsets per month. This might be small in the Indian market for mobile phones which is estimated at 100 million per annum, but it is not insignificant. In the lucrative multimedia segment of the market, the brand hopes to capture 7 to 10 per cent share before it completes one year.About PCH: PCH is the new corporate brand identity for PC House PLC which was recently listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. The new brand identity reflects the change from a family owned business to a public company with a vision to be the benchmark for ICT in Sri Lanka.PC House was incorporated as a limited liability company in the year 2000, after having commenced business in 1997 and became PCH PLC. Its Board of Directors consists of Messrs S.H.M. Rishan, Mangala Boyagoda, Sarath Wikramanayake, Modarage Thilakasiri, Shanti Kumar Nadarajah, Kuvera de Zoysa and Mrs. Sharmila Rishan.Photo caption: Mr. Failan Saleem (left) COO - PCH Mobile and Mr. S.H.M.

There hasnt been a single dull moment for me orfor ODEL since inception, she said. ODEL may have happened quite by accident. But what followed in the subsequent decades was far from accidental.We made a determined effort at unlocking ways to indulge each customer, and creativity across the world provided a muse for our eclectic brand. Butmostly, it was our own imagination that inspired us, the imagination of a team, who like me, wakes up each morning challenging our boundaries. I believethat is what makes us distinctly different from the rest. It is this incredible energy, and our understanding of what our customers want, is what will help usdrive ODEL into the world of possibilities that the IPO is opening up for us, Ms. Gunewardene said.Now comprising 12 stores and with its latest store in Battaramulla poised to open in July, ODEL is well positioned to ride the wave of optimism and growth asSri Lankas economy grows in the post-conflict area. The company is set to benefit from higher levels of domestic consumption activity amid fast- improvingmacroeconomic conditions that are expected to contribute to rising disposable income levels in the country.ODEL is also synonymous with tourists for shopping in Sri Lanka, and the companys centrally-located flagship store is one of the most sought-after touristshopping destinations in the island. With the conclusion of the 26-year separatist insurgency last year, tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka are expected to surge torecord highs, and ODEL is set to capitalize on this opportunity as an internationally recognized fashion brand among tourists to Sri Lanka.In addition to building the brand equity of ODEL over the years, Ms. Gunewardene has also created several other related brands, including Backstage foran extensive range of fashion accessories and Embark for a cause-linked product range that supports a personal community programme focused on thewelfare of community animals.The Board of Directors of ODEL Limited comprises Ruchi Gunewardene (Chairman), Otara Gunewardene (CEO), Paul Topping, Sanjay Kulatunga andEardley Perera.

310,"Sri Lankan security agencies are stepping up surveillance, harassment, and threats against human rights activists and journalists, says Human Rights Watch (HRW).In a news release issued yesterday (03), the New York-based non-governmental rights organization claimed that there has been a rapid closing of civic space and freedom of expression in the country since November 2019, when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa assumed office.Human Rights Watch states that it has received consistent accounts of increased surveillance and pressure from security agencies from interviews with 15 Sri Lankan human rights defenders working in different locations across the country.The news release went on to say several of these accounts have claimed that intelligence officials had asked activists and victims of their advocacy plans ahead of the 43rd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), which kicked off in Geneva on February 24.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since the return of the Rajapaksas to power, a state of fear is being re-established in Sri Lanka,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of the HRW. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The activities of the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security apparatus are evident in some violent attacks and public death threats against activists and journalists, but also in equally dangerous actions happening out of sight.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe news release further said that President Rajapaksa has placed a number of important civilian agencies under the Defence Ministry, including the civilian police and the NGO Secretariat, which regulates nongovernmental groups, among dozens of others. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He has appointed a serving military officer as head of the civilian intelligence agency and a retired general, Kamal Gunaratne, who is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as defence secretary.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe HRW alleges that, over the past three months, unidentified people have physically attacked journalists several times, and issued death threats against reporters perceived as critical of the government. It says that the police and intelligence officers have made attempts to induce fear in rights groups by visiting their offices and demanding personal details including staff lists, home addresses.The news release says that, between 2005 and 2015, the United Nations had found credible evidence that the Sri Lankan government was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.The HRW went on to claim that, over the last five years, Sri Lankan intelligence agencies have also commenced targeting financial and administrative records of nongovernmental organizations, and especially details of funding from donors abroad.Commenting on Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to withdraw from the Human Rights Council resolution 30/1, which Sri Lanka endorsed in 2015, the HRW stated members of the Human Rights Council should support a new resolution Ã¢â‚¬Å“to establish an international mechanism or tribunal to address past crimes in Sri Lanka.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSpeaking on the travel ban issued by the United States on Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army chief Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva due to his purported involvement in gross violations of human rights, the HRW has urged other countries including EU members and the United Kingdom to follow suit and impose sanctions on him and others credibly accused of serious rights violations and war crimes.The EU should also remind Sri Lanka of its human rights obligations under the European UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GSP+ system of trade preferences and of the consequences of failing to comply, the HRW noted in its release.Read the complete news release of the Human Rights Watch below:Sri Lankan security agencies are stepping up surveillance, harassment, and threats against human rights activists and journalists, Human Rights Watch said today. Since November 2019, when the government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa came into office, there has been a rapid closing of civic space and freedom of expression.In interviews with 15 Sri Lankan human rights defenders working in different locations around the country, Human Rights Watch heard consistent accounts of increased surveillance and pressure from security agencies. Several said that intelligence officials had asked activists and victims about their advocacy plans ahead of the current United Nations Human Rights Council session, which began on February 24, 2020 in Geneva. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We fear that international lobbying and travel to Geneva may not happen in future because of this situation,Ã¢â‚¬Â one activist said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Since the return of the Rajapaksas to power, a state of fear is being re-established in Sri Lanka,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director.

Security officials have searched media offices. The Defence Ministry announced on January 24 that it had drafted a new cybersecurity law to prevent people from publishing Ã¢â‚¬Å“defamatory postsÃ¢â‚¬Â on social media. The proposals have not yet been published.Several human rights activists described receiving repeated phone calls from intelligence officers. Some of these calls have apparently been to tell activists that they are being watched at that moment. On other occasions the caller asks questions or issues threats or warnings.One human rights defender said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“everything has shifted into a critical situation. After the election, military activities including monitoring and inquiries have increased. They are following us. That is a huge threat for human rights groups.Ã¢â‚¬Â Another activist said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We collected stories and documents. Now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve stopped everything. We did a lot of work. Now, zero.Ã¢â‚¬Â A third activist said she so constantly feels under surveillance that intelligence officers Ã¢â‚¬Å“might even be in the next seat on the bus.Ã¢â‚¬ÂPolice and intelligence officers have sought to instil fear in rights groups by visiting their offices and demanding staff lists, home addresses, and other personal details. One activist said the authorities came to his office demanding this information, but then revealed that Ã¢â‚¬Å“they knew already everything. My personal details, they knew it. This is part of the intimidation.Ã¢â‚¬ÂMany of these activists carry out research and advocacy on abduction, torture, murder, and enforced disappearance allegedly committed by security forces, including members of the intelligence agencies and the military, between 2005-2015 when Gotabaya Rajapaksa was defense secretary during the administration of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is now prime minister. During those years the United Nations found credible evidence that the Sri Lankan government was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.An activist whose group works on so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“white vanÃ¢â‚¬Â abductions and enforced disappearances allegedly committed by intelligence officers under the previous Rajapaksa administration said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is in question what will happen to me and my staff.Ã¢â‚¬Â Another activist said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am even more scared because the kind of inquiry that has been happening is about peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s families, so that is even more frightening than if they are asking about our official activities.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe intelligence agencies have also begun to target the financial and administrative records of nongovernmental organizations over the last five years, and especially details of funding from donors abroad. Activists fear the authorities will allege accounting errors as a pretext to shut them down or to bring criminal charges.Several human rights groups based in eastern Sri Lanka have been summoned for questioning in Colombo by the police Terrorist Investigation Department (TID). One human rights activist said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the investigation they told us, Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou have used money you received from abroad for terrorist activities in Sri Lanka. You are involved in terrorist activities, that is why you have been called for investigation.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ÂOn February 26, the Rajapaksa government said it would no longer abide by Human Rights Council resolution 30/1, which Sri Lanka endorsed in 2015. Resolution 30/1 commits Sri Lanka to ensuring truth and justice for past abuses. An activist said that Sri Lankan human rights groups that worked in support of Resolution 30/1 now find themselves vulnerable: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now the government is saying you are urging the people to disturb the peace [by supporting resolution 30/1]. They say, Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou have no right to do it.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ÂMembers of the Human Rights Council should, as a matter of priority, support a new resolution to establish an international mechanism or tribunal to address past crimes in Sri Lanka, Human Rights Watch said.On February 14, the United States banned Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army chief, Gen. Shavendra Silva, from travel to the US due to Ã¢â‚¬Å“his involvement, through command responsibility, in gross violations of human rights, namely extrajudicial killingsÃ¢â‚¬Â during Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civil war. Other countries, including EU members and the United Kingdom, should follow suit and impose sanctions on him and others credibly accused of serious rights violations and war crimes.The EU should also remind Sri Lanka of its human rights obligations under the European UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GSP+ system of trade preferences and of the consequences of failing to comply.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sri Lankans are seeing their civil and political rights being stripped away and replaced by authoritarian structures at a rapid pace,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ganguly said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crucial for the UN Human Rights Council to remember the past, respond to the warning signs, and resolutely insist on fundamental human rights principles, including delivering justice to victims.Ã¢â‚¬Â",OTHER,OTHER,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=61151,67,,Other Ethnic groups,News
311,"Amnesty International is concerned by multiple reports of harassment, intimidation and attacks on human rights organisations, media outlets, and journalists in Sri Lanka.Amnesty International, in a public statement issued yesterday (16), said it has received reports that the authorities carried out more than a dozen unscheduled visits to human rights and media organisations between May 2019 and January 2020 that were seen as acts of harassment and intimidation.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The targets included human rights organisations, and media outlets, who said they were questioned about their activities by members of the Sri Lankan Police, including the Criminal Investigation Department and the Terrorism Investigation Division, as well as State Intelligence,Ã¢â‚¬Â says the Amnesty International.At least twelve cases recorded by Amnesty International indicate that the Sri Lanka Police, including the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) also known as Counter- Terrorism and Terrorism investigation Division (CTID), as well as officials with State Intelligence, have visited the premises of, or summoned members of human rights organizations, making enquiries around project activities, donors and funding information, registration, and details of staff members.According to Amnesty International, the reports indicate that such visits have occurred for several months over 2019, spilling into 2020, in different parts of the country including in the Northern, Eastern and Western Provinces on an ad hoc and arbitrary basis since May, however more systematically particularly in the Western Province since November 2019.Ã¢â‚¬Å“This trend of information gathering by different law enforcement agencies serve as a form of harassment and intimidation, and must be seen in the context of attacks, surveillance and harassment of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) that Amnesty International has documented as having occurred intermittently for several years. Such harassment and intimidation have a chilling effect by way of suppressing dissent, creating fear in organizations and individuals defending and promoting human rights about the start of a crackdown, and may amount to reprisals for their work.Ã¢â‚¬ÂAmnesty International stresses that Sri Lanka has an international obligation to protect HRDs under a number of international human rights treaties including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which it is a state party.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Covenant guarantees the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and expression,Ã¢â‚¬Â the statement read further.",OTHER,OTHER,Positive,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=60268,25,,Other Ethnic groups,News

320,"Fashion giants H&M and Gap Inc vowed on Tuesday to investigate reports that Asian garment workers who supply their high-street stores routinely face sex abuse, harassment and violence.Based on interviews with some 550 workers in 53 H&M and Gap supplier factories in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, rights groups said women were at Ã¢â‚¬Å“daily riskÃ¢â‚¬Â of violence, and faced retaliation if they reported the attacks.The coalition has investigated the factories for several years as efforts mount to push Western brands into improving safety along their supply chains and render them slave-free.Clothes stitched by low-paid Asian workers - part of a complex global supply chain - end up on high-priced Western high streets, with some 4,750 H&M stores located in 69 countries and about 3,700 Gap shops operating in about 90 nations.SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s H&M - the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s No. 2 clothes group after Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC) - said it would review the findings of the recent report by the civil society groups and unions.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will go through every section of the report and follow up on (a) factory level with our local teams based in each production country,Ã¢â‚¬Â a company spokesman said in a statement.Ã¢â‚¬Å“All forms of abuse or harassment are against everything that H&M group stands for.Ã¢â‚¬ÂU.S. retailer Gap said it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“deeply concerned about the troubling allegations raised by this reportÃ¢â‚¬Â.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our global team is currently conducting our due diligence to investigate and address these issues,Ã¢â‚¬Â a spokeswoman said.The charities said they had found widespread sex harassment, verbal and physical abuse - such as slapping - and threats of retaliation when women refused sexual advances from bosses.FORCED LABOR?A separate report published last month by the coalition of rights groups found similar abuse of women at supplier factories in Asia for U.S.-based Walmart, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest retailer.Walmart said last month that it was reviewing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“concerningÃ¢â‚¬Â accounts cited in the report.The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), a group of trade unions, firms and charities of which both Gap and H&M are members, said it expected the retailers to work with the suppliers to ensure that women have swift access to remedy.Ã¢â‚¬Å“These allegations are deeply concerning,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Debbie Coulter of the ETI. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gender-based violence is unacceptable under any circumstances, and brands need to make sure that women working in their supply chain are protected.Ã¢â‚¬ÂCampaigners told the Thomson Reuters Foundation last month that the level of pressure and harassment faced by the workers in the three separate reports was approaching forced labor.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Any time you have retaliation against workers, and coercion and control ... you are coming close to the line of forced labor,Ã¢â‚¬Â Jennifer Rosenbaum of Global Labor Justice (GLJ), a network of worker and migrant organizations, said last month.The reports have been published amid meetings hosted by the United NationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ International Labour Organization (ILO) to work on the first global convention against workplace harassment after the #MeToo campaign thrust the issue into the spotlight.Source: Thomson Reuters Foundation-Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=47919,34,,Other Ethnic groups,News

He apologized for causing pain.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them,Ã¢â‚¬Â Weinstein said in a statement.A Hollywood guessing game immediately began.

By the evening, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly FactorÃ¢â‚¬Â no longer bore his name, simply titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Factor.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe downfall of FoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular Ã¢â‚¬â€ and most lucrative Ã¢â‚¬â€ personality began with an April 1 report in The New York Times that five women had been paid a total of $13 million to keep quiet about disturbing encounters with OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly, who continued to deny any wrongdoing in a statement hours after he was fired. Dozens of his showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advertisers fled within days, even though OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s viewership increased.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exit came nine months after his former boss, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, was ousted following allegations of sexual harassment.Following the Times story, 21st Century Fox said it had asked the same law firm that investigated Ailes to look into OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behavior. 21st Century Fox leaders Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James said in a memo to Fox staff that their decision to ax OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly came following an Ã¢â‚¬Å“extensive reviewÃ¢â‚¬Â into the charges.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I understand how difficult this has been for many of you,Ã¢â‚¬Â Rupert Murdoch said in a memo to Fox staff.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly, denied a chance to say goodbye to his Fox viewers, did so via a statement.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

Bill has been the undisputed king of cable news, and for good reason.Ã¢â‚¬ÂShe also noted his devoted fans and their loyalty to the show.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly, 67, had ruled the Ã¢â‚¬Å“no spin zoneÃ¢â‚¬Â on television with a quick smile and an even quicker temper. He pushed a populist, conservative-leaning point of view born from growing up on Long Island, and was quick to shout down those who disagreed with him. Fans loved his willingness to talk back to power or point out hypocrisy among liberal politicians or media members.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly and President Donald Trump are both Ã¢â‚¬Å“crowd-pleasing showmen who know how to signal to loyalists in their audience that they are not taking themselves quite as seriously as their detractors are,Ã¢â‚¬Â said news consultant Andrew Tyndall. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Half of the fun that they have with their audiences comes from watching the outrage that they manage to provoke.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“What Rush Limbaugh was to talk radio, Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly has been to conservative television,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Mark Feldstein, communication professor at the University of Maryland. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t underestimate the influence and the profits that he brought into Fox News for all these years and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why they hesitated so long in doing the right thing.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHis show generated $178 million in advertising revenue in 2015, according to Kantar Media. Before the advertising boycott, there was the prospect of even more: his audience was larger in the first three months of 2017 than it has ever been. With a profit center gone, 21st Century Fox stock fell almost 1 percent Wednesday in heavy trading.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pugnacious personality wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just an onscreen affectation, with one of the settlements going to a woman who complained about being shouted at in the newsroom. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly was alleged to have slowed the careers of women who spurned his advances. One former Fox personality, Juliet Huddy, said she pulled away and fell to the ground when he tried to kiss her, and he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help her up, the Times reported.One harassment case, from a former producer who said OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly called her and described sexual fantasies and appeared to be masturbating, dated back more than a decade and was widely reported then. While OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly survived then, the accumulation of cases outlined in the Times damaged him much more extensively. For Fox executives, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t clear when it would end: a campaign to target advertisers was continuing, a group of women demonstrated in front of FoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headquarters Tuesday and another woman, a former clerical worker at Fox, called a harassment hotline and accusing the host of boorish behavior.Some of OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critics were happy with the news.Author Stephen King tweeted: Ã¢â‚¬Å“New book by Fox News: Killing Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly.Ã¢â‚¬Â It referred to OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s series of best-selling books on the deaths of major historical figures.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mission accomplished,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Keith Olbermann, who frequently tweaked OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly on an MSNBC show that competed in the same time slot for several years. Olbermann said that when he was working at Fox Sports in 1999, he helped a friend get a job at Fox News. She quit the job Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the business Ã¢â‚¬â€ due to her treatment by OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly, he said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“This has been going on for decades and I hope his having to go out in shame and disgrace makes things just a little bit better for her and all his victims right now,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Certainly they make things better for America.Ã¢â‚¬ÂBut many of OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fans took to social media to express their unhappiness at losing their hero. Several suggested that Fox had essentially caved to a left wing campaign. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help that the controversy was set in motion by the Times, a publication hated in conservative circles.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lawyers said he was the victim of an orchestrated campaign by liberal organizations like Media Matters for America, which contacted his advertisers to pressure them to leave the show. Conservative personality Glenn Beck Ã¢â‚¬â€ who once lost a job at Fox because a similar campaign choked his program of paying advertisers Ã¢â‚¬â€ came to OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense on his radio show.Ã¢â‚¬Å“You need to write and call Fox News Channel today and tell them, you can lose your advertisers or you can lose your viewers,Ã¢â‚¬Â Beck said on his radio show hours before the firing. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But you have to put some spine back into the Murdoch family and the Fox News Channel board because you are about to lose Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe was too late.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly is also one of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular nonfiction authors. The books in his Ã¢â‚¬Å“KillingÃ¢â‚¬Â historical series, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killing LincolnÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killing Reagan,Ã¢â‚¬Â have consistently sold 1 million or more copies in hardcover, a rare achievement in publishing, and his platform on Fox enabled him to promote his work. He has also had best-sellers with everything from the memoir Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Bold Fresh Piece of HumanityÃ¢â‚¬Â to his most recent work, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old School,Ã¢â‚¬Â which includes passages urging the respectful treatment of women.OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly and co-author Martin Dugard are due to release another book in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“KillingÃ¢â‚¬Â series in September, and a spokeswoman for publisher Henry Holt and Co. said that plans had not changed.Vatican spokesman Greg Burke confirmed OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly was in the VIP section for the popeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wednesday appearance. Burke, a former Fox News correspondent in Rome, denied having facilitated the tickets. Such tickets can be obtained via special request to the papal household from embassies, high-ranking churchmen or Vatican officials.Francis always swings by the VIP seats at the end of his audience for a quick round of handshakes.

331,"Ninety per cent of women in Sri Lanka have endured sexual harassment while taking public transport, a new study commissioned by UNFPA has found.The findings, released last week, offer a stark view into womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vulnerability to violence and discrimination, issues that are poorly understood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both in Sri Lanka and globally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ because of underreporting and lack of data.Despite the absence of formal data, these issues are all too familiar to women and girls, the survey confirms.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have witnessed, on multiple occasions, male passengers inappropriately touching and leaning on small girls,Ã¢â‚¬Â said a 23-year-old study participant. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bus conductors also unnecessarily touch small children when getting on to the bus.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe study also shines a light on the far-reaching effects this harassment has on the lives of women and girls, from their educations and livelihoods to their place of residence and personal relationships.Humiliated and afraidInitiated in 2015, the study included 2,500 individuals between the ages of 15 and 35. Information was gathered through interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. Every administrative district in all of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nine provinces was represented.Women reported experiencing a wide range of mistreatment on public transport, including leering, verbal abuse and unwelcome advances, but the majority of harassment was physical.Seventy-four per cent of women and girls reported they had been deliberately touched. Sixty per cent reported their personal space had been invaded, and 52 per cent said the offenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genitals were rubbed against their bodies.Ninety-seven per cent said the perpetrators were male.Women in the survey described feeling humiliated and afraid.Pushing women from public lifeWomen in Sri Lanka Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially low-income women Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rely heavily on public transport. Half of female study participants said they use it to go to work, and 28 per cent said it was how they travelled to pursue their educations.There is evidence that harassment and the threat of harassment are limiting womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mobility, participation in public life and overall well-being.A quarter of survey participants said harassment occurred monthly. About 12 per cent said it occurred daily. In some cases, women reported it was so frequent, and alternative modes of travel so scarce, that they moved residence to escape.Forty-four per cent of women said that harassment on public transport affected their personal lives. Twenty-nine per cent said it had an impact on their school performance, and 37 per cent said it negatively affected their work performance.Ã¢â‚¬Å“As a nurse I have to work late nights,Ã¢â‚¬Â Thilini, 31, said in a focus group. Ã¢â‚¬Å“On one occasion, after leaving work exhausted, I got onto a bus and noticed a male passenger seated behind me. He was well-dressed and in his mid-40s. He started unnecessarily touching me, and as I objected, he told me that I should travel in a private vehicle.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThese abuses Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the culture of inequality they spring from Ã¢â‚¬â€œ may be contributing to womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic marginalization. According to the Census on Population and Housing, labour force participation among women fell from over 39 per cent in 2006 to less than 35 per cent in 2014.Better data to inform policiesThe study has started a conversation, not only on safety in public transport but also on the wider issues of violence, womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights and gender equality.UNFPA is currently working with government officials to raise awareness of these matters, and to spread word about a hotline women can call to report abuses. They are also working towards gathering more data on gender discrimination and violence, in order to inform policies that better uphold the rights of women.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The study is important as it highlights the grave gender discriminations that persist towards women and girls,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Sharika Cooray, a UNFPA gender analyst in Sri Lanka.It is also Ã¢â‚¬Å“a first step in addressing the data gap at a national level on violence against women,Ã¢â‚¬Â she added.Source: unfpa.org-Agencies",WOMEN,OTHER,Neutral,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=39511,87,,Women,News

335,"Almost 29 percent of Sri Lankan female journalists have experienced sexual harassment in the work place according to the latest survey conducted by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), the New Indian Express reported.Dilrukshi Handunnetti, the author of the survey reportsaid that out of the 45 female respondents, 13 (ie: 28.8 percent ) said that they had experienced sexual harassment in the work place.But this could well be the tip of the iceberg as most cases are not reported, for a variety of reasons. Such incidents are brushed under the carpet partly because there is lack of support from colleagues, female as well as male; and partly because complaints lodged are generally ignored by the organization. One of the victims, a Colombo-based English language journalist, told Handunnetti: Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I complained to the department head that I was being harassed sexually by the Associate Editor, there were other men who were old enough to be my father, advising me not to upset colleagues. When I objected to lack of action by the Head, I was offered free advice by other men, who told me to avoid spitting on my own face by raising these issues.Ã¢â‚¬ÂShockingly, the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s female colleagues advised her to ignore the incident Ã¢â‚¬Å“for the sake of peace.Ã¢â‚¬Â But the last straw was when her Department Head asked her to withdraw her complaint and sign a document claiming she had Ã¢â‚¬Å“misunderstoodÃ¢â‚¬Â the situation.Three other journos, including two in supervisory positions, had their buttocks touched by a middle-aged male colleague. But they did not complain because their colleagues described the act as Ã¢â‚¬Å“normal male behaviorÃ¢â‚¬Â.More than half of the women who had experienced sexual harassment (69.23 percent) said that the perpetrator was a colleague; 30.77 percent said it was a superior and 15.38 percent said it was an interview subject.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The absence of complaints and redress mechanisms contributes to the reluctance on the part of women to complain against incidents of sexual harassment, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Handunnetti further said.",WOMEN,OTHER,Negative,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=30064,24,,Women,News

337,"Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Australia, Admiral Thisara Samarasinghe, on Thursday rejected claims of human rights abuses and harassment of asylum seekers being returned to the island nation.Asked what would happen to those who are returned to Sri Lanka, he said they would face the magistrates court and be released on bail.If there is criminal evidence of such people, they would be punished and put through the normal process, Admiral Samarasinghe told Sky News.The Australian government is unrepentant in its refusal to discuss Tamil asylum seekers reportedly being sent back to Sri Lanka, amid claims it has thrown its moral compass overboard.The government will not confirm reports they have been or would be handed over to Sri Lankan authorities after being intercepted trying to reach Australia by boat.Handing them back would constitute a violation of Australias responsibilities under the United Nations refugee convention.The reports say one boat came from India with 153 Tamil asylum seekers, including about 30 children, and a second, carrying 50 people, might have sailed from Indonesia.But for almost a week, Australia Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have said the governments policy is not to divulge on water operations.The Australian government ... is always cognisant of our international obligations and relevant conventions, Mr Morrison also said on Thursday.Mr Abbott said Sri Lanka was a peaceful country no longer plagued by civil war.I dont say its a perfect country, Mr Abbott said.There are also reports that Australia is screening the Tamil asylum seekers at sea via video link, and some will be handed into Sri Lankan custody, also at sea, after being asked just four basic questions.The UN refugee agency has expressed concern about any processing short cuts that may risk putting already vulnerable individuals at grave risk of danger.Asylum seekers must be properly screened for protection needs in a way they can understand and lets them explain their needs, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement.The Tamil Refugee Council accused the Australian government of not just ignoring human rights abuses but becoming an eager facilitator.Australias moral, ethical and legal compass has been lost at sea, Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Trevor Grant said.Labors immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, demanded the government come clean with the Australian people.Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has confirmed an eight-week-old Australian-born baby is among a group of 14 asylum seekers from four families sent from the South Australian Inverbrackie detention centre to Darwin.They will be transferred to Christmas Island because they have been deemed fit to return to the island, Sky News reports.

342,"                   The US State Departments report on human rights states that attacks on and harassment of civil society activists, LTTE sympathizers and journalists is creating an environment of fear and self-censorship in Sri Lanka. The U.S. State Department in its Country Reports On Human Rights Practices for 2012, highlights involuntary disappearances as well as a lack of accountability for thousands who disappeared in previous years. The report released by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Washington on Friday (April 19) says major human rights problems include widespread impunity for a broad range of human rights abuses, particularly involving police torture, and attacks on media institutions and the judiciary.Other serious human rights problems included unlawful killings by security forces and government-allied paramilitary groups, often in predominantly Tamil areas; torture and abuse of detainees by police and security forces; poor prison conditions; and arbitrary arrest and detention by authorities, the report said. It states that lengthy pretrial detention and denial of fair public trial remained a problem in the country, and that during the year there were coordinated moves by the government to undermine the independence of the judiciary. The report faults the government for infringing on citizens privacy rights while pointing out that there were restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and movement. Authorities harassed journalists critical of the government and self-censorship was widespread. There were reports that the government, its agents, or its paramilitary allies committed arbitrary or unlawful killings, but reliable statistics on such killings were difficult to obtain, because past complainants were killed and some families feared reprisals if they filed complaints, the report said.The report charged that members of law enforcement in the country beat and otherwise abused criminal suspects and others.Among these alleged arbitrary or unlawful killings, there were reports of suspects detained by police or other security forces who died under questionable circumstances.There were numerous reports throughout the year of victims randomly selected by police to be arrested and detained on unsubstantiated charges, it said.While the overall number of extrajudicial killings appeared to decrease from previous years, killings and assaults on civilians by government officials was a problem, the document said.Enforced and involuntary disappearances continued to be a problem, the document said.The report further says: Some abductions included government critics, former LTTE cadre, and other targets, leading observers to conclude the involvement of the government or government-allied forces in several cases.On the conditions of the countrys prisons it said they were poor and did not meet international standards due to overcrowding and the lack of sanitary facilities.

He later reported her to police. In a statement to the court, MrStokes said she had put him and his wife through hell and her persistentcommunications had caused considerable stress.He said: The hurtful stories she concocted from herderanged imagination became more and more aggressive and led me to fear for thesafety of my wife and children.He said the threat of harassment continued and he felt hehad to check his house at night.Miss Hart said: The police contacted Wickramaratna tellingher not to contact Mr Stokes but she wrote back revealing explicit details oftheir affair that she believed had taken place and referred to herself as thecougar.She later left the electronics company in Portsmouth whereshe worked with Mr Stokes, and moved to a communications firm in SheptonMallet, Somerset.There she met a new male colleague, Pir Khan, and startedsending him accusatory messages before reporting him to the companys owner,Kazeem Benzair.Miss Hart said: Mr Khan received a message from the defendantasking if he would stop making uncomfortable gestures towards her and hereplied saying he did not understand what comments she was referring to.A number of abusive messages were then sent but thedefendant claimed they had been sent by her boyfriend Jeremy  a man whom thepolice were not able to ascertain even existed.She then reported Mr Khan to Mr Benzair for harassment andboth parties were put on gardening leave from the firm.

347,"                   Lawmakers of the European Parliament (MEPs) have underlined the need for Europe to be more supportive of Sri Lankas reconciliation and reconstruction process rather than constant harassment, amid global pressure on the government to address alleged human rights violations. A group of European Parliament members (MEPs) led by Geoffrey Van Orden said Europe needs to be more supportive of Sri Lankan post-conflict reconciliation and reconstruction, rather than constant harassment. On the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), Van Orden said that international organizations which had dubbed it a whitewash had been proved dramatically wrong. The group said they had been encouraged by the steps already taken by the Lankan government towards reconciliation such as the parliamentary select committee on devolution, promotion of a trilingual policy and bilateral talks with the main Tamil party TNA, according to a release by the government of Sri Lanka. - PTI ",OTHER,OTHER,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=16702,7,,Other Ethnic groups,News

351,"                   Sexual harassment in the workplace is an untapped but essential area to be covered specially in the Asian part of the world, says the founder of Epitom Consulting Mr. T. Ragulan. Ragulan, also notifies that this sensitive issue will be taken up by Dr. Arosha S. Adikaram, a senior lecturer in Human Resources Management at the Faculty of Management and Finance, University of Colombo on 27th of July 2011 at Galle Face Hotel from 5.30 pm to 8.30 pm. Dr. Adikaram has continuously and actively contributed to the cause of eliminating sexual harassment from workplaces during the past 10 years through numerous research, workshops and awareness programs, as well as through local and international publications on the subject. One of her papers, Sexual harassment among women in the banking sector of Sri Lanka received the Best Paper Award at the International Conference on Business and Information (BAI) held in Singapore in 2006. Dr. Adikaram was also honored as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) of the year 2010 for her academic accomplishment and leadership by Junior Chamber International (JCI) Sri Lanka, and was awarded the Pride of HR Profession award, by the World HRD Congress in India, for her contribution to the field of human resources management.Dr. Adikaram has a number of publications to her credit, including the books titled Is Sexual Harassment a Problem in Sri Lankan Workplaces (publishers: Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and Sri Lanka Foundation) and Labor Law and Relations: a Human Resource Management Approach (publisher: Stamford Lake Publications). Dr. Adikaram, pointing out the importance of raising awareness about the issue of sexual harassment at workplaces in the Sri Lankan working community says that more than 50% of working women and about 7% of working men are subject to sexual harassment at workplace around the world. She further says that Having been involved in research and teaching on sexual harassment at workplaces for the last decade, I have been appalled to realize how grave and prevalent this phenomenon is among Sri Lankan working females, and how almost all of these instances go unaddressed and unnoted. Unlike many other countries around the world, in Sri Lanka the issue of sexual harassment is not taken seriously, and not addressed properly. It is not even considered by many as a topic worthy of discussion. Unless companies realize the importance of eradicating sexual harassment from workplaces and also deal with instances of sexual harassment effectively, there is very little the victims can do. The first step in combating sexual harassment and avoiding the many negative consequences of sexual harassment, is by raising awareness about the issue among the working community and encouraging companies to develop effective policies and procedures to deal with the issue Dr Adikaram adds.Epitom Consulting, a promising business consultancy firm which is striving to serve the knowledge base of Sri Lanka has initiated to talk openly about this untouched and sensitive topic. This aspect of work life plays hidden but massive role in deciding the performance of the employees, an organizations reputation, a countrys image about its corporate culture. The workshop is scheduled to take place on 27th of July 2011 at Galle Face Hotel from 5.30 pm to 8.30 pm. Ragulan ensures that the workshop would help the participants to identify what sexual harassment at workplace means, explain the importance of eradicating sexual harassment from workplaces, identify what organizations should do in preventing and handling sexual harassment instances, and identify what victims of sexual harassment should do in dealing with their experiences.

354,"(New York)- The Sri Lankan government should end its harassment of journalists andactivists and take steps against those making threats, Human Rights Watch andAmnesty International said in a joint statement today.Since the January 2010 presidential election, the governmenthas engaged in a campaign to silence and discredit journalists andnongovernmental organizations. A recently leaked document, which appears to bea government surveillance list of more than 30 journalists and activists,significantly raises concerns about the safety of the people on the list, theorganizations said.ÃƒÂ¢The Sri Lankan government is conducting a carefullycoordinated witch hunt aimed at discrediting critics of the government,ÃƒÂ¢ saidBrad Adams, Asia director at Human RightsWatch. ÃƒÂ¢This is extremely dangerous and irresponsible in a country wherejournalists and activists have often been threatened and killed.ÃƒÂ¢On March 4, the directors of two highly respected Sri Lankanorganizations, the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and TransparencyInternational Sri Lanka (TISL), wrote a joint letter to President MahindaRajapaksa expressing their grave concern about a press report of thegovernmentÃƒÂ¢s apparent surveillance list. The list places the directors of theCPA and TISL among several people in the top category, presumably meaning thatthey are under particularly close surveillance.News about the government surveillance list emerged amidst agovernment campaign in the media to discredit nongovernmental organizations. Inseveral statements since February 20, government officials have made vague andunproven accusations against various groups, claiming that they have attemptedto ÃƒÂ¢destabilize democracyÃƒÂ¢ in Sri  Lanka.Concerns about the safety of individuals on the allegedgovernment surveillance list are heightened because of previous death threatsand attacks, the organizations said. In September 2008 unknown persons threwtwo grenades at the TISL directorÃƒÂ¢s house. In August 2009 the director of theCPA received an anonymous death threat by mail. The authorities have failed tohold anyone accountable for either of the incidents.Both the CPA and TISL played a crucial role in monitoringthe January presidential election, reporting on electoral violations and thegovernmentÃƒÂ¢s misuse of state resources to campaign in favor of the incumbent,Mahinda Rajapaksa.ÃƒÂ¢This smacks of retaliation for reporting on violationsduring the presidential election,ÃƒÂ¢ said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty InternationalÃƒÂ¢sAsia-Pacific director.

357,"A draft of a potential climate deal at the COP28 summit on Monday suggested a range of measures countries could take to slash greenhouse gas emissions, but omitted the Ã¢â‚¬Å“phase outÃ¢â‚¬Â of fossil fuels many nations have demanded - drawing criticism from the U.S., EU and climate-vulnerable countries.The draft has set the stage for contentious last-minute negotiations in the two-week summit in Dubai, which has laid bare deep international divisions over whether oil, gas and coal should have a place in a climate-friendly future.A coalition of more than 100 countries have been pushing for an agreement would for the first time promise an eventual end to the oil age - but are up against opposition from members of the oil producer group OPEC.COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber - who has previously used the conference to call for a paradigm shift - urged the nearly 200 countries at the talks to redouble their efforts to finalize a deal ahead of the scheduled close of the conference on Tuesday, saying they Ã¢â‚¬Å“still have a lot to doÃ¢â‚¬Â.Ã¢â‚¬Å“You know what remains to be agreed. And you know that I want you to deliver the highest ambition on all items including on fossil fuel language,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.The new draft of a COP28 agreement, published by the United Arab EmiratesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ presidency of the summit, proposed various options but did not refer to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“phase outÃ¢â‚¬Â of fossil fuels.Instead, it listed eight options that countries could use to cut emissions, including: Ã¢â‚¬Å“reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050Ã¢â‚¬Â.Other actions listed included tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, Ã¢â‚¬Å“rapidly phasing down unabated coalÃ¢â‚¬Â and scaling up technologies including those to capture CO2 emissions to keep them from the atmosphere.Alden Meyer, a senior associate at environmental think tank E3G, criticised the new deal as Ã¢â‚¬Å“basically an a la carte menu that allows countries to individually choose what they want to do.Ã¢â‚¬ÂDespite the fact emissions from burning fossil fuels are by far the main driver of climate change, 30 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth of international climate negotiations have never resulted in a global agreement to cut their use.The text triggered a protest from dozens of delegates who stood in near silence, holding hands and lining the long route into a room where negotiators gathered, forcing them to run an eerie gauntlet before getting back to work.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Please give us a good text,Ã¢â‚¬Â one delegate pleaded as negotiators filed in.U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry told the meeting, which ran for around three hours, that the draft agreement had to be strengthened.Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not where weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re meant to be in terms of the text,Ã¢â‚¬Â Kerry said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Many of us have called for the world to largely phase out fossil fuels, and that starts with a critical reduction this decade.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSpeaking with voice worn hoarse by the summit, he said the outcome of COP28 was existential: Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is a war for survivalÃ¢â‚¬Â.EU chief negotiator Wopke Hoekstra told reporters the draft was Ã¢â‚¬Å“clearly insufficient and not adequate to addressing the problem we are here to address.Ã¢â‚¬ÂRepresentatives from Pacific Island nations Samoa and the Marshall Islands, already suffering the impacts of rising seas, said the draft was a death sentence.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We will not go silently to our watery graves,Ã¢â‚¬Â said John Silk, the head of the Marshall Islands delegation.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We cannot sign on to a text that does not have strong commitment on phasing out fossil fuels,Ã¢â‚¬Â Samoa environment minister Cedric Schuster told reporters.Dan Jorgensen, the Danish climate minister, said he believed many countries opposed the current text. Ã¢â‚¬Å“So, it was clear that this is only the starting point and that we are not even close to getting a result.Ã¢â‚¬ÂA new draft document is expected early on Tuesday, which would leave little time for further disagreement ahead of the conferenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scheduled close at 0700 GMT. COP summits rarely finish on schedule.Sources familiar with the discussions said the UAE had come under pressure from Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the OPEC oil producersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ group of which UAE is a member, to drop any mention of fossil fuels from the text.Saudi ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.CONSENSUSIt was unclear if China, currently the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top greenhouse gas emitter, supported the draft.Leaving their pavilion late on Monday, senior members of the China delegation, including chief envoy Xie Zhenhua, did not respond to questions.But observers noted that some of the language in the document was in line with ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous policy positions, as well as parts of the Sunnylands agreement signed by China and the United States in November.The Sunnylands agreement did not use phrases like Ã¢â‚¬Å“phasing outÃ¢â‚¬Â but instead called for the accelerated substitution of coal, oil and gas with renewable energy sources, and backed the pledge to triple renewable energy by 2030.Speaking to ministers and negotiators on Sunday, a representative for Saudi ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delegation said a COP28 deal should not pick and choose energy sources but should instead focus on cutting emissions.That position echoes a call made by OPEC in a letter to its members earlier in the summit, seen by Reuters, which asked them to oppose any language targeting fossil fuels directly.Deals at U.N. climate summits must be passed by consensus among the nearly 200 countries present.Developing nations have said any COP28 deal to overhaul the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy system must be matched with sufficient financial support to help them do this.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We need support as developing countries and economies for a just transition,Ã¢â‚¬Â said ColombiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Environment Minister Susana Muhamad. Colombia supports phasing out fossil fuels.Despite the rapid growth of renewable energy, fossil fuels still produce around 80% of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy.Negotiators told Reuters that other OPEC and OPEC+ members including Russia, Iraq and Iran, have also resisted attempts to insert a fossil fuel phase-out into the COP28 deal.Source: Reuters--Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Negative,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=95580,4,,Other Ethnic groups,News
358,"Sri Lanka and Argentina remain very vulnerable amid a worsening in global financial conditions while China has suffered a sharp deterioration in financial resilience since pre-COVID times, a think-tank study found on Wednesday.The resilience indicator, published by the Washington-based Center for Global Development, assesses which countries would be most economically and financially affected if an external shock were to materialise. It is based on data published by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and governments.China was found to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“most weakened countryÃ¢â‚¬Â across a sample of 37 countries, having ranked among the top 10 most resilient emerging economies in 2019 and dropping to 18th place in 2023.Emerging markets were now more vulnerable than in 2019 on an overall basis, economist Liliana Rojas-Suarez wrote in the report.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The scars of the 2020-2022 shocks that started with the COVID pandemic and the subsequent multiple shocks, such as RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war on Ukraine and the U.S. FedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increases in interest rates, are deep and have weakened emerging marketsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ economic and financial conditions,Ã¢â‚¬Â Rojas-Suarez wrote.A severe shortage of dollars tipped Sri Lanka into its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 last year, triggering its first foreign debt default in May 2022.Argentina is in recession for the sixth time in a decade, with triple-digit inflation and foreign net reserves in the red.The study also showed that debt sustainability has declined over the last four years across emerging market economies.Ã¢â‚¬Å“In 2019, only Tunisia, Pakistan, Argentina, and Sri Lanka had ratios of external financing needs above 100%. Now, 12 of the 37 countries we examined, or about one third, are in that position,Ã¢â‚¬Â Rojas-Suarez said, adding these countries have very large and unsustainable large public debt ratios.The study calculated external financing needs by measuring short-term external debt plus current account deficits as a proportion of international reserves.Bolivia, Egypt, Turkey and El Salvador are also on the list of vulnerable countries, while the study shows that Indonesia, Peru and Bulgaria are the most resilient countries in the group.Source: Reuters--Agencies",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=94684,6,,Other Ethnic groups,News
360,"The crushing economic crisis in Sri Lanka last year has left more than half of the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population Ã¢â‚¬Å“multidimensionally vulnerableÃ¢â‚¬Â, according to a national citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ survey led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).The study spanning the years 2022 and 2023 and covering 25,000 households across the country, found 55.7 % of the population to be vulnerable across three dimensions Ã¢â‚¬â€ education, health and disaster, living standards Ã¢â‚¬â€ and 12 indicators, including school attendance, physical condition [of health], unemployment and indebtedness. In effect, the survey showed that 12.34 million people out of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 22.16 million-strong population have been badly affected by the crisis and remain vulnerable amid claims of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“recoveringÃ¢â‚¬Â economy. The findings are in line with earlier research by UN agencies on food insecurity levels and reaffirm anecdotal accounts of poor families cutting down their food intake and pulling their children out of school to cope with the high living costs.The findings of UNDPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study carried out in partnership with the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCitra Social Innovation LabÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ anchored at the Prime MinisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office, assume significance, especially after the government rejected a UNICEF report that pointed to high malnutrition levels among Sri Lankan children last year.Notably, the recently launched UNDP report said a majority, or 82 %, of those found to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“multidimensionally vulnerableÃ¢â‚¬Â lived in rural Sri Lanka. It underscored the need for Ã¢â‚¬Å“more policy focusÃ¢â‚¬Â in those areas. Further, the study found a third of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population gets into debt for essential needs like food, medical care, education, and pawning jewellery or selling items.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Several districts, including Ampara, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Puttalam, and Vavuniya, exhibit notable multidimensional vulnerability values, with over 65 percent of their populations identified as vulnerable,Ã¢â‚¬Â the report said, indicating that people living in the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tamil-majority north and east, impacted by the civil war, and the economically-marginalised Malaiyaha Tamil community, are among those facing the highest levels of economic deprivation. Capital Colombo and the neighbouring Gampaha districts emerged as regions with the highest concentration of vulnerable individuals, a trend that the study attributed to their substantial population sizes.Road to recoveryLast yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial meltdown pushed Sri Lanka to bankruptcy and brought its citizens to the streets as they contended with acute shortages, long power cuts, and a dramatic increase in prices. A year after defaulting on its foreign debt in the wake of a stifling balance of payments problem, the government obtained International Monetary Fund (IMF) support in March 2023 by way of a $ 3 billion package to be disbursed over four years.While President Ranil Wickremesinghe has pledged to set the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy on a path of recovery, his government is struggling to reach an agreement with its external creditors. Colombo must finalise a debt treatment plan before the IMFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scheduled review this month, as the second tranche of the IMF loan is contingent on it.Further, the government recently announced its decision to restructure its domestic debt, mainly by recasting the outgo on the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pension funds. Worker unions have been fiercely opposing the move. In a recent letter to the IMF, more than 80 Sri Lankan organisations and trade unions said subjecting workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pension funds to domestic debt restructuring Ã¢â‚¬Å“will diminish the returns to wage-earners and deplete the fund to half its current value.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your debt restructuring program is crippling working people in Sri Lanka who run our economy and create value in our society. The economic reforms you have imposed on us, without reflecting on the negative consequences of the previous reforms enacted over 16 IMF interventions, are crushing our economy,Ã¢â‚¬Â they told the Fund.Meanwhile, Central Bank data showed a further slowdown in headline inflation in August, dropping to 4 % from 6.3 % recorded last month. Still, the numbers are yet to translate to relief for most citizens, especially because of last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exceptionally high base effect, even as incomes have remained stagnant. The government Ã¢â‚¬â€ in adherence to the IMF programme Ã¢â‚¬â€ recently began making cash transfers to 1.5 million families out of the 2 million it has identified as poor and eligible. Many more families are protesting, asking to be included on the list. However, womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s groups and government critics argue that a targeted social security programme, amounting to 0.6% of the GDP, will prove grossly inadequate to combat the severe economic strain many face.Source Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Hindu--Agenices",OTHER,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=93113,16,,Other Ethnic groups,News

368,"Delegates from nearly 200 counties at the COP27 climate summit have agreed to set up a loss and damage fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters, in a landmark deal early Sunday morning in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.But while the deal represents a breakthrough in what has been a contentious negotiation process, delegates were still working to hammer out other controversial parts of the agreement, including a proposal to include a call to phase out all fossil fuels, rather than just coal.The deal marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the European Union, have agreed to establish a Ã¢â‚¬Å“loss and damageÃ¢â‚¬Â fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.Negotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks said the fund was a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.The fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.The US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ËœReparationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,Ã¢â‚¬Â Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.Ã¢â‚¬ÂDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t set specific future deadlines.And while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.Ã¢â‚¬Å“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,Ã¢â‚¬Â World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.Ã¢â‚¬ÂAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“They needed to be together to force the conversation weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re having now,Ã¢â‚¬Â Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to push the conversation.Ã¢â‚¬ÂFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devastating flooding this summer.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was like a big buildup,Ã¢â‚¬Â former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This has been around for quite a while and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.Ã¢â‚¬ÂTense final hoursThe conference first went into overtime on Saturday before continuing into the early hours of Sunday morning, with negotiators still working out the details as the workers were dismantling the venue around them. At points, there was a real sense of fatigue and frustration. Complicating matters was the fact that Kerry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the top US climate official Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is self-isolating after recently testing positive for Covid, working the phones instead of having face-to-face meetings.And earlier in the day Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement fails to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Global scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees. Beyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.In a carefully choreographed news conference Saturday morning, the EUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Green Deal tsar Frans Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that Ã¢â‚¬Å“no deal is better than a bad deal.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.The EU made it clear that it was willing to agree to a loss and damage fund Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a major shift in its position compared to just a week ago Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but only in exchange for a strong commitment on the 1.5 degree goal.As the sun went down on Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday evening, the mood shifted to cautious jubilation, with groups of negotiators starting to hint that a deal was in sight.But, as is always the case with top-level diplomacy, officials were quick to stress that nothing is truly agreed until the final gavel drops.Source - CNN-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=86257,4,,Not relevant,News

378,"IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official death toll from COVID-19 crossed 500,000 on Friday, a level many health experts say was breached last year but obscured by inaccurate surveys and unaccounted dead in the hinterlands, where millions remain vulnerable to the disease.The country, which has the fourth-highest tally of deaths globally, recorded 400,000 deaths by July 2021 after the devastating outbreak from the Delta variant of the coronavirus, according to official data. Some experts believe the figures were much higher.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our study published in the journal Science estimates 3 million COVID deaths in India until mid-2021 using three different databases,Ã¢â‚¬Â Chinmay Tumbe, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad who co-authored the study, told Reuters.Last month, the Indian government dismissed the study as baseless in a notification saying there is a robust system of birth and death reporting.IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s states record deaths from COVID after collating data from their districts. In the last few months, several states have updated the number of deaths, some under pressure from the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top court. In most instances, authorities said there were lapses due to delayed registrations and other administrative errors.India is currently in the midst of a third wave of the coronavirus led by the Omicron variant, which some top experts say is already in community transmission although federal officials say most cases are mild.Last month, the government eased testing norms and told states to drop mandatory testing for contacts of confirmed cases unless they were old or battling other conditions. But, with the number of tests falling, the government issued a revised circular warning states they would miss the spread of the virus.But, as many infected people took the option of not testing at all, total infection numbers may not reflect the extent and severity of cases, said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University near the capital who has been tracking the spread of the virus.According to official figures, IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overall number of COVID infections has reached 41.95 million, the second-highest globally behind the United States.To prevent new surges, the government has vaccinated three-fourths of the eligible 939 million adult population with the mandatory two-dose regime.Indian officials are carrying out a vaccination drive in remote parts of the country to increase lagging vaccination rates, with health workers going door-to-door to administer shots.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I make them understand how important vaccines are to escape from coronavirus,Ã¢â‚¬Â health worker Asmita Koladiya, who is forced to take her infant daughter along with her because of a lack of childcare, told Reuters.RECONCILIATION WITH TIME, GRIEFIndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cumulative tally of 500,055 deaths on Friday included 1,072 fatalities reported over the last 24 hours, according to the federal health ministry.

381,"The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed on Thursday at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COVID-19 vaccine programme COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with two other less likely scenarios.Vaccine makers Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), with its German partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE), have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its Ã¢â‚¬Å“indicativeÃ¢â‚¬Â baseline scenario, and boosters every two years for the general population.It does not say how these conclusions were reached, but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.The U.N. agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document.A spokesperson for Gavi said COVAX was planning to take a wide range of scenarios into consideration.The document, which is dated June 8 and is still a Ã¢â‚¬Å“work in progress,Ã¢â‚¬Â also predicts under the base case that 12 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year.That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signalling that the U.N. agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and Ã¢â‚¬Å“transition away from some technology platformsÃ¢â‚¬Â as potential drags on supplies next year.It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest volume of COVID-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).WORST-CASE SCENARIOThe scenarios will be used to define the WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerges on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to GaviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estimates.This gap could widen next year under the WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could once again push poorer nations to the back of the queue.In its worst-case scenario, the U.N. agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones.That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world.There would be no need for boosters as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.Source: Reuters-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=74918,3,,Not relevant,News
382,"The World Health Organization urged countries on Friday to donate COVID-19 vaccine doses to inoculate the most vulnerable in 20 poorer nations after India, a key supplier to the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, said it was prioritising local needs.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the COVAX programme, run with the GAVI vaccine alliance, needed 10 million doses immediately to inoculate healthcare workers and older people as a stop-gap measure.Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVAX is ready to deliver but we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deliver vaccines we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have. Bilateral deals, export bans, vaccine nationalism and vaccine diplomacy have caused distortions in the market with gross inequities in supply and demand,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tedros told a news conference.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ten million doses is not much and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not nearly enough,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.India, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest vaccine maker, said on Friday it would make domestic inoculations a priority. The move will hit COVAX supplies as some of AstraZenecaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vaccine is produced by the Serum Institute of India.Tedros thanked India for its exports so far and said the move was Ã¢â‚¬Å“understandableÃ¢â‚¬Â given rising infections. He added that talks with India were underway to find a balance between local and international needs.So far COVAX has delivered 32 million vaccine doses to 61 countries, but 36 countries still await vaccines to start inoculations, he said.Tedros has said countries should work together to ensure COVID-19 vaccinations begin everywhere across the world within the first 100 days of 2021, or by April 10.WHO senior adviser Bruce Aylward said that talks with well-supplied countries about donations were underway and that some had expressed Ã¢â‚¬Å“positive interestÃ¢â‚¬Â, without naming them.Meanwhile a long-awaited report into the origins of the novel coronavirus, following a WHO team trip to Wuhan, China in January and February, would be released in the next few days, team leader Peter Ben Embarek said.

Sri Lanka firmly believes that this Summit will serve as an important platform for the NAM Member States to support collective global action in combating this deadly virus and sharing best practices and lessons learned.I extend my deepest condolences to all those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic and express deep appreciation to the frontline healthcare and essential workers, both in Sri Lanka and globally, for their dedication and selfless commitment.Sri Lanka remains deeply concerned by the unprecedented consequences arising from this pandemic to all our countries and peoples, including its catastrophic health impacts, accompanying humanitarian crisis, the devastation of economies, and social and psychological tensions, among others.Sri Lanka, therefore, is pleased to endorse the declaration of this Summit.Sri Lanka recognizes the timely initiative to establish a NAM Task Force to compile a database of basic humanitarian and medical needs of the member states to sensitize donors on urgent requirements.We commend the Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID 19 Global Humanitarian Response PlanÃ¢â‚¬Â and the establishment of the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.Sri Lanka also supports the endeavors of the WHO which has been playing a vital role in shaping the global response to the pandemic.Sri Lanka has been successfully containing and controlling the COVID-19 threat. Out of the total PCR tests conducted so far, only 3% have been confirmed as infected. The death rate is at a very low level of 0.97%.In early February, my government established a Task Force comprising key health personnel, high-ranking military personnel, and administrators to monitor the spread of the pandemic and also to take required measures to combat the spread of the virus.The first Covid-19 Sri Lankan patient was identified on March 11th. Initially, patients were Sri Lankans who came from several countries. Since then, 717 infected persons have been detected, 183 persons have been cured and discharged while 527 persons are being treated as active cases. Most of these persons were asymptomatic. We adopted a few special and unique measures: the establishment of quarantine centers managed by the Armed Forces and the deployment of the State Intelligence Services, the police and Public Health Inspectors to do contact tracing. Both these measures have helped Sri Lanka cope with this pandemic quite successfully enabling the health authorities to function at the optimum level.Whenever a person afflicted with the virus was detected the contact tracing method was used to find out details of persons with whom the afflicted person had come into contact. Once identified, all such persons were taken to a specially designated quarantine center, or arrangements were put in place to self-quarantine such persons. If an entire area was found to have been contaminated, such areas were isolated and quarantined. Of the 31 clusters identified so far, 27 have been completely neutralized while the other 4 are being kept under strict control eliminating any spill over to the general population.There have also been extensive PCR testing and health authorities are continuing to conduct more PCR tests.Given an excellent free healthcare system that includes a well-established preventive mechanism placed throughout the country, Sri Lanka has been able to contain the spread of this deadly virus utilizing the public health processes.In order to assist the health authorities and other services deployed to combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus, my government declared a curfew from March 18th throughout the island and restricted movement of people. With work coming to a standstill, Sri Lanka has taken a series of measures to mitigate the challenge.

Therefore, it is important to also focus on their needs at this particular juncture and accord the necessary financial support to avert negative economic consequences.Sri Lanka believes that national and regional level initiatives complement and strengthen the global response to the crisis.

Report excerpt;A new study on the frequency of past giant earthquakes inthe Indian Ocean region shows that Sri Lanka, and much of the Indian Ocean, isaffected by large tsunamis at highly variable intervals, from a few hundred tomore than one thousand years. The findings suggest that the accumulation ofstress in the region could generate as large, or even larger tsunamis than theone that resulted from the 2004 magnitude-9.2 Sumatra earthquake.Researchers from the University of Miami (UM) RosenstielSchool of Marine and Atmospheric Science and the University of Peradeniya inSri Lanka collected and analyzed 22 sediment cores from Karagan Lagoon,Hambantota in southeastern Sri Lanka, to expand the historical record of giantearthquakes along the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone, where theIndo-Australian plate and Eurasian plate meet. Using sand deposited in thelagoon during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and seven older paleo-tsunamideposits as proxies for large earthquakes in the region, the scientistsreconstructed the timeline for mega-earthquakes along the Indian Oceans plateboundary from Myanmar to Indonesia, assuming that the tsunamis were allgenerated by large earthquakes.In Sri Lanka, coastal lagoons were inundated by thistsunami and others that occurred over thousands of years, said Gregor Eberli,professor of Marine Geosciences and director of UMs CSL  Center for CarbonateResearch. These lagoons are ideal repositories for tsunami sand layers becauseafter deposition, the tsunami sands were sealed with mud.The Dec. 26, 2004 M-9.2 Sumatra earthquake resulted in atrans-oceanic tsunami, with wave heights up to 100 feet (30 meters) in someplaces, which impacted much of the Indian Ocean region causing widespreaddamage in southeastern Sri Lanka.During the a 7,000-year record of Indian Ocean tsunamispreserved in the sediment, the research team found evidence that estimated thetime period between consecutive tsunamis from 181 (up to 517) years and 1045 (Ã‚Â±334) years. The longest period was nearly twice the time period prior to the2004 earthquake.These results are very important to better understand thetsunami hazard in Sri Lanka, said Kelly Jackson, UM Rosenstiel School Ph.D.candidate and lead author of the study.A scary result is a 1000-year time period without atsunami, which is nearly twice as long as the lull period prior to the 2004earthquake, said Falk Amelung, professor of geophysics within the departmentof Marine Geosciences at the UM Rosenstiel School. This means that thesubduction zone is capable of generating earthquakes almost twice as big as in2004, although we dont have any evidence yet that this actually happened.The 2004 tsunami caught us completely by surprise, althoughwe should have known better because there is a Sri Lankan legend in which thesea came ashore in 200 B.C., says Chandra Jayasena, a geologist at theUniversity of Peradeniya. We now need to study other lagoons to further expandthe historical record of large tsunami-generating earthquakes in the region andget a better understanding of the earthquake frequency in this highly populatedregion.The regions subduction zone exhibits great variability inrupture modes, putting it on the list with the Cascadia Subduction Zone, whichstretches from Vancouver Island to northern California and Chile, according tothe authors.The paper, titled Holocene Indian Ocean tsunami history inSri Lanka, was published in the Aug. 15 early online edition of the journalGeology.

A strong reliance on oil product imports in Asia has also heightened their risk, he said.Asia countries import nearly 30 percent of their consumption needs, mostly from refineries in South Korea, Singapore and India, which are in turn dependent on the Middle East for more than half of their crude supplies.How product-exporting companies and countries chose to allocate reduced supplies would affect Australia and Thailand in particular, said Mitchell, who started his career in with U.K. oil major BP Plc in 1966.Australia has seen a series of refinery closures, and by 2015, it is expected to become the largest net importer of diesel and second-largest net importer of gasoline in Asia, importing more than half of its fuel needs.Product-importing countries, particularly Australia and Thailand, could face shortfalls of 5-10 percent of consumption in the event of a significant disruption to Middle Eastern supplies, Mitchell said in the report.If Middle East oil producers choose to look after their own, by supplying to joint venture refineries in Asia and the United States first, however, this could lessen the impact of a disruption at the expense of European countries, he said.Low levels of oil stocks, especially in India, remained a worry, Mitchell said, adding that there needs to be greater coordination on emergency oil stocks release among the International Energy Agency, China and India.The burden of a spike in oil import costs will be greater on South Asian countries - Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India - as more than 30 percent of their revenues from non-oil exports were used to pay for oil imports in 2012, the study showed.In theory China could cover a 50 percent increase in the price of oil imports by drawing down foreign reserves at about 3 percent annually for 30 years, Mitchell said.Pakistans reserves would be exhausted within one year and those of India, Australia and Sri Lanka within about five years, he said, Reuters reports.

403,"Financially vulnerable media houses in Sri Lanka have beensubject to further pressures as increased costs passed on from banks threatenstheir sustainability, The International Federation of Journalists said in itsreport on Sri Lanka. The report adds that in addition, change of ownership hasoften resulted in rapid changes in editorial policies and personnel.The International Federation of Journalists, incollaboration with partners and affiliates released situation reports onjournalists rights and the state of media freedom in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.The information presented in the reports is the result ofextensive consultations between the IFJ and its partners, field visits andinterviews by IFJ personnel in the two countries.The reports highlightthe current priority areas for campaign and advocacy work in the two countriesand identify focus areas for future international solidarity actions.Excerpt from report;IFJ partners in Sri Lanka have been campaigning for mediafreedom to be recognised as an essential part of the process of nationalreconciliation, following the end of the countrys quarter-century long civilwar in 2009. Their efforts are yet to be recognised, since few reforms havebeen implemented in the media sector and the recommendations of a high-levelcommission on national reconciliation remain largely on paper.Media reporting on the process of resettlement andrehabilitation in the countrys Northern Province, which suffered the worstravages of the civil war, has often been impeded by security personnel whocontinue to be deployed there. And far from assuring accountability for thenumber of attacks and killings of journalists during the war, the pattern ofviolence has persisted in the years following.Journalists and human rights defenders are often attacked byofficial spokespeople on government-controlled media channels, contributing toan atmosphere of intolerance for even legitimate criticism of the government.Websites that carry news and current affairs content on Sri Lanka have beensubject to arbitrary rules of registration and in some cases, to police raidsand seizure of equipment.Financially vulnerable media houses have been subject tofurther pressures as increased costs passed on from banks and financialinstitutions threatens their sustainability. In addition, change of ownershiphas often resulted in rapid changes in editorial policies and personnel.The revival of the Press Council of Sri Lanka is seen toembody a very real coercive intent on the part of the government, since the1973 law under which the body is constituted conceives of a number of possiblesanctions against the media, including the power to prosecute under variousprovisions of criminal law. The Sri Lanka Press Complaints Commission, aself-regulatory body set up by the media industry, has been seeking toestablish its credentials as an institution that is fully equipped to deal withcurrent challenges.The situation reports on Bangladesh and Sri Lanka wereprepared with the financial support of UNESCO, under the InternationalProgramme for the Development of Communications (IPDC).

404,"                   Sri Lanka is illegally holding hundreds of detainees who are vulnerable to torture and execution, claimed Amnesty International Tuesday in a report urging UN support for a probe into alleged war crimes.The 63-page document entitled Locked away: Sri Lankas security detainees, said arbitrary and illegal detention and enforced disappearances were routine in Sri Lanka, where rights abuses go uninvestigated and unpunished.The LTTE had a horrific record of abuse, including killing and imprisoning its critics, but that did not, and does not, excuse the widespread and systematic mistreatment of detainees by the Sri Lankan government, said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty Internationals Asia-Pacific Director.The Amnesty report was published in Geneva where Sri Lanka is currently seeking to head off a US move to censure Colombo at the UN Human Rights Council.Zarifi said little has changed since the end of the war with the LTTE, with security authorities still taking advantage of laws allowing them to imprison people for months or years without trial.The message coming from the Sri Lankan government is that those who dare criticise it risk harassment or even disappearance, he said, adding peaceful government critics, including journalists, had been threatened and arrested.Foreign Minister Gamini Lakshman Peiris said two weeks ago there were 750 Tamil Tiger ex-combatants still in detention. Amnesty said former detainees had been harassed, re-arrested and physically attacked.If Sri Lanka is serious about ending impunity and committed to reconciling communities torn apart by conflict, the rule of law needs to be a large part of that equation, Zarifi said.He added that the war crimes alleged in Sri Lanka in the final stages of the war were of such magnitude that they risked undermining international justice mechanisms if unchallenged. The UN must support an independent international investigation into these alleged crimes, he said. -AFP ",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=17324,13,,Not relevant,News
405,"                   A new global financial crisis would hit Asia harder than the last one, especially nations heavily exposed to offshore markets or still repairing budgets from the 2008-2009 crisis, credit ratings agency Standard and Poors said on Monday.The agency, which incurred Washingtons wrath at the weekend by cutting its AAA rating by a notch to AA+, said it was not predicting a rerun of the credit crisis that crippled markets and tipped the world economy into recession three years ago.But it warned of more sovereign downgrades in Asia next time around, if its assumptions turned out to be wrong.If a renewed slowdown comes, it would likely create a deeper and more prolonged impact than the last one, S&P said in a statement.The implications for sovereign creditworthiness in Asia-Pacific would likely be more negative than previously experienced, and a larger number of negative rating actions would follow. We wait to see.S&P said it assumed Europes debt crisis and Washingtons debt problems were unlikely to lead to abrupt dislocations in the financial systems and economies of major developed nations.On that basis, it added, its historic downgrade of the US credit rating would have no immediate knock-on impact on sovereign borrowers in the Asia-Pacific.It cited the Asia Pacific regions sound domestic demand, relatively healthy corporate and household sectors, plentiful external liquidity and high savings rates  though it listed New Zealand, Japan and Vietnam as exceptions to this.The S&P statement took on a much darker tone when considering the possibility that its assumptions were too rosy, noting that Asia still relied heavily on exports to the West.Given the interconnectivity of the global markets, an unexpectedly sharp disruption in developed-world financial markets could change the picture, it said, noting that the US and European economies could again contract or stagnate.In this scenario, the experience of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 shows that export-dependent economies with large exposures to the US and/or Europe would feel the most pronounced economic impacts, S&P said.Its not likely things would be very different this time.The agency listed those countries particularly vulnerable to disruptions in offshore capital markets as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Indonesia.It also said several nations, again including New Zealand, were also still repairing their government finances and could be more constrained in responding to a fresh global crisis.The adverse impact on Asia Pacific in that scenario would likely require governments to use their balance sheets to support their economies and financial sectors once again, S&P said.And in our opinion, most governments would promptly oblige. But some of them continue to bear the scars of the recent downturn  the fiscal capacities of Japan, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and New Zealand have shrunk relative to pre-2008 levels. - Reuters ",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=14466,2,,Not relevant,News

The agency has also invoked various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in the case.It was on March 18 this year that a Sri Lankan fishing vessel, Ravihanshi, was intercepted by the Coast Guard from which 300kg of heroin, five AK 47 rifles and 1,000 pieces of ammunition were seized. The Narcotics Control Bureau registered a case first following the seizure of heroin and arrested six crew members -- all Sri Lankan nationals.The case related to the seizure of AK 47 rifles and ammunition was first registered at Vizhinjam police station which was later taken over by NIA. The national agency has so far arrested 15 persons of whom 10 are from Sri Lanka including three staying illegally in India.During the probe, NIA found links of the accused with LTTE and that the smuggling of drugs and weapons was part of an attempt to revive the proscribed terrorist organization.

421,"British mercenary pilots helped Indian troops in their battle against the Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in Sri Lanka in the 1980s, a new book reveals for the first time.The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) received air support from these for-hire British pilots despite Indian diplomats publicly condemning the presence of UK mercenaries in Sri Lanka, according to the book, Ã¢â‚¬ËœKeenie Meenie: The British Mercenaries Who Got Away With War CrimesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, authored by UK-based investigative journalist Phil Miller.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Despite India publicly opposing the presence of British mercenaries in Sri Lanka, my research reveals that by 1987 the Indian military were using white pilots to provide air cover for their operations in Jaffna in what appears to have been a case of my enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemy is my friend,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Miller.IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret use of British mercenaries lasted for four months after the Indo-Lanka accord was signed between former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and then Sri Lankan president J.R. Jayewardene in 1987.The book also traces the involvement of British mercenaries in atrocities against Tamil civilians that occurred prior to the arrival of the IPKF.Ã¢â‚¬ËœKeenie MeenieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, from the title of the book, is thought to be a Arabic slang for covert activities and was run by a retired colonel, Jim Johnson, a former Special Air Services (SAS) commander who had conducted secret missions in Yemen and Oman.JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s counter-insurgency experience came to the attention of Jayewardene at the start of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civil war in 1983, when the Anglophile leader was looking for British aid to defeat the Tamil Tigers.Britain refused to officially send troops to help Jayewardene, fearing it would have jeopardised Ã¢â‚¬Å“substantial commercial and defenceÃ¢â‚¬Â deals with India, who initially supported the Tamil separatists, notes the account.Former prime minister Indira GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal envoy to Sri Lanka, Gopalaswami Parthasarathy, warned BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most senior diplomat Sir Antony Acland that Ã¢â‚¬Å“UK training of Sri Lankan security forces would not be helpfulÃ¢â‚¬Â.Instead, declassified documents reveal, Britain allowed retired UK soldiers to work in Sri Lanka under the control of Keenie Meenie Services (KMS).BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high commissioner in Colombo, David Gladstone, noted in a telegram: Ã¢â‚¬Å“(Colonel) Johnson confirmed that KMS pilots were flying SLAF (Sri Lankan Air Force) helicopters in support of IPKF operations in the Jaffna peninsula until 27th November (1987), when the last pilot was withdrawn...IPKF will miss the support provided by their pilots.Ã¢â‚¬ÂGladstone added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Indians may after all come to regret the reduction in the KMS presence here. In the circumstances, it is not surprising we have heard no recent criticism from Indian sources of KMS activities.Ã¢â‚¬ÂBy 1985, BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Foreign Office believed that Ã¢â‚¬Å“only KMS pilots are currently capable of flying armed helicopter assault operations in Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬Â.MillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, published by Pluto Press and formally launched in London last week, cites declassified cables that show British diplomats expected there would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“very hard words from IndiaÃ¢â‚¬Â if a KMS pilot was shot down by the Tamil militants.IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s then foreign secretary, Romesh Bhandari, described the situation in Sri Lanka as Ã¢â‚¬Å“genocideÃ¢â‚¬Â and warned that the role of the British pilots was Ã¢â‚¬Å“unhelpfulÃ¢â‚¬Â.However, IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attitudes gradually began to shift and the envoy to Colombo, Jyotindra Nath Dixit, said New Delhi had to publicly deplore the use of UK mercenaries in Sri Lanka but privately he accepted there was Ã¢â‚¬Å“a large pool of ex-military personnelÃ¢â‚¬Â in Europe and North America who wanted to Ã¢â‚¬Å“market these skillsÃ¢â‚¬Â and if it was not KMS then it would be another Ã¢â‚¬Å“cowboyÃ¢â‚¬Â outfit involved.The KMS came into being in the 1970s with battle-hardened British veterans and, according to the book based on previously classified accounts, were active in controversial operations around the world with the UK governments of the time unable to fully control them.Source: PTI-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=60644,8,,Not relevant,News

Some are former members of the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which represented the LTTE in Switzerland until 2009, and include its founder, his deputy and the person in charge of finances.Between 1999 and 2009, they allegedly created a complex fundraising structure which involved coaxing members of the Tamil diaspora to obtain loans from banks. To raise higher amounts, the WTCC was accused of creating fictitious companies in the name of borrowers that issued fake salary certificates.The 13 on trial face charges of fraud, false documentation, money laundering and extortion. As the LTTE was never declared a terror organisation in Switzerland, they will not face charges of funding a terror group, unlike cases involving Islamic State or al-Qaeda.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Attorney General strongly suspects the LTTE fraction under investigation of having collected the money in question by means of threats and by creating a regime of fear to induce them to make the payments,Ã¢â‚¬Â says a court documentexternal link.The Swiss funds were transported in cash by couriers to Singapore and Dubai, eventually reaching the LTTE in Sri Lanka who allegedly used the money to purchase arms. This funding system collapsed in 2009 after the LTTEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military defeat at the hands of the Sri Lankan armed forces.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think [the 13 suspects] should face trial as the LTTE struggled for the freedom and self-determination of Tamils, which is not a crime. It takes two parties to make a war and Switzerland should investigate the war crimes of the Sri Lankan army as well,Ã¢â‚¬Â Anna Annor, president of Swiss Council of Eelam Tamils, told swissinfo.ch on Thursday.Long-drawn sagaThe whole process was set in motion in 2009 when the Office of the Attorney General launched an investigation against Ã¢â‚¬Å“unknown personsÃ¢â‚¬Â for extortion, coercion, money laundering and organised crime.In 2011, a vast sting operation in several Swiss cantons resulted in the arrest of several suspects who were later released within a span of two months. A year later, a delegation from the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Police travelled to Sri Lanka to interview around 15 witnesses.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Around 80% of Tamils living in Switzerland had made payments to support LTTE at the time to support the struggle against genocide. That does not make Tamils supporters of terrorism,Ã¢â‚¬Â says Kuruparan Kurusamy, former president of the Swiss Council of Eelam Tamils.The trial of the accused was originally scheduled for June 2016. However, proceedings were delayed when the lawyer of one of the accused demanded that a bank involved in the financial transactions also be cited by the judge as one of the defendants. According to Kurusamy, the bank in question was Credit Suisse and he claims it had accepted 135 loans under the name of one Sri Lankan national based in Germany.However, the Federal Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, allowing the trial to go ahead. A verdict is expected around mid-March. Around 50,000 people from Sri Lanka live in Switzerland, mostly ethnic Tamils, who fled the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 30-year civil war that ended in 2009. Many applied for Swiss citizenship and as of 2016 there were slightly more than 28,000 people with Sri Lankan citizenship residing in Switzerland. In 2016, the Swiss government announced it would apply more stringent criteria for granting Sri Lankan nationals refugee status.Source: swissinfo.ch-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=45212,13,,Not relevant,News
445,"It is now known that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) executed Mahattaya, the organisationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy leader, in the mid-1990s on the charge of being an agent of Indian intelligence.A compilation of documents from the LTTEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political wing published now says the dreaded militant group believed that it had got conclusive proof against him only after he was left out of the charge-sheet in India in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, filed in 1992.The documents suggest Mahattaya, whose real name was Gopalasamy Mahendraraja, was accused by the LTTE leadership of not only tipping off Indian security agencies about the whereabouts of a ship carrying its front-ranking leader Sathasivam Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, in early 1993, but also hatching a plot to kill the supreme leader V. Prabakaran.The documents, now part of the book published by VOC Noolagam, say it was intelligence wing leader Pottu Amman who foiled the alleged attempt to assassinate Prabakaran.Under the LTTE intelligence scanner for long, it was his non-inclusion in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case charge-sheet that confirmed Pottu AmmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doubts about Mahattaya, the documents claim.Pottu Amman had grown suspicious of Mahattaya immediately after Kittu lost a leg in a grenade attack in March 1987. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The area did not come under any attack from the Sri Lankan Army. Rival groups were also totally inactive. Then who would have been responsible for the blast?Ã¢â‚¬Â asks one of the documents.KittuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival in Jaffna was a closely guarded secret and only top leaders were aware of it. Who leaked it to the Indian intelligence agencies? This was a question that bothered Pottu Amman, who waited for further evidence. Mahattaya did not attend KittuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral.The political wing statements suggest that the LTTE interrogated many Mahattaya supporters, including cadre who escaped from custody in India during this period.Barring Mahattaya, all others admitted to their role in their statements, the documents claim. They had been promised money and IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support if the conspiracy succeeded. A bodyguard of Prabakaran lodged in an Indian prison was released and given special training. As per MahattayaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan, the assassin should plant a time-bomb in PrabakaranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bed.

446,"The refusal of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to accept the Indo-Sri Lankan accord of 1987 led to a war between India and the Tigers, but the militant group claimed that the then Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran unequivocally supported its stand on the issue.Details of a tense conversation between LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran and Indian diplomat J.N. Dixit give an idea about how the LTTE viewed the accord and the enmity it induced between the organisation and the Indian government.The LTTE alleged that India, particularly J.N. Dixit, sought to arm-twist the organisation into giving its approval for the accord, but that MGR threw his weight behind Prabhakaran, who resisted the idea.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whatever be you decision, I will support it,Ã¢â‚¬Â MGR is quoted as saying in a publication by the LTTE that has become part of a voluminous book published by Chennai-based VOC Noolagam.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The LTTE periodically came out with documents explaining its stand on various issues in India and Sri Lanka and we have collected them. We are going to launch the compilation as a book, along with the biography of Velupillai Prabhakaran,Ã¢â‚¬Â said poet Ilayabharathi of VOC Noolagam.In fact, the LTTE had then described 1987, the year in which the accord was signed, as a year in which Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Tamil Eelam freedom movement survived a difficult phase.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“The liberation movement was crushed like copra in an oil press. It was a year of Sani (Saturn),Ã¢â‚¬Â the LTTE had alleged.Narrating the events preceding the signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, the LTTEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s publication said Prabhakaran was picked up by an Indian Air Force helicopter from the Suthumalai Amman temple in Jaffna. He was taken to Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi. Anton Balasingham, the LTTE ideologue, and Dileepan, another LTTE leader, were also with him.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dixit gave them a copy of the accord and urged them to give their stand in one hour. It is an accord between two governments and you cannot make any amendments. We expect you to accept it,Ã¢â‚¬Â Dixit told the leaders, it said.Dixit met the LTTE leader after an hour, but Prabhakaran had made it clear he could not disband the 15-year-old movement sustained by the blood of Tamils in 72 hours. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You expect us to give up arms before achieving a solution? We cannot drop the weapons that provide security to our people without any assurance. We cannot accept the accord without the approval of our people,Ã¢â‚¬Â Prabhakaran had told Dixit and other officials.Dixit told them, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whether you accept it or not, the accord will be implemented. If you do not give up your arms, we will use the Indian Army to complete the task. Do not forget that you are under our custody and there is no guarantee that you can leave this place.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬ËœYou will be destroyedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢When Prabhakaran stood his ground, Dixit said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“India is a superpower and you are a small armed group. Think before whatever you say. You will be destroyed.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThen he asked Balasingham to take a decision in consultation with Prabhakaran and others. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The next two days passed with RAW and IB officials putting pressure on him to accept the accord. As they realised they could not succeed in their attempt, India sought the help of Chief Minister MGR,Ã¢â‚¬Â the LTTE said.But Prabhakaran rejected the proposal in front of MGR who was flown to Delhi by the central government. Listening to both sides, MGR told Dixit that he wanted to discuss the issue with Prabhakaran.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prabhakaran was wondering what would be on MGRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind. He wondered whether MGR would urge us to support the accord and whether it will lead to breaking of relationship between the LTTE and him. But MGR smiled at him and made clear his stand,Ã¢â‚¬Â the publication said.Prabhakaran then decided to meet Rajiv Gandhi since all other attempts to convince the Indian officials failed.India Ã¢â‚¬Ëœs former national security adviser and former foreign secretary J.N. Dixit, was also IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high commissioner in Sri Lanka from April 1985 to April 1989He was the High Commissioner in Colombo in 1987 when India signed an accord with Sri Lanka government and deployed of the Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF).J.N. Dixit in his book, Assignment Colombo, had recalled the lengthy exchange he had with Prabhakaran on all the details of the agreement in the presence of MGR and Panruti S. Ramachandran.Ã¢â‚¬Å“But Prabhakaran remained indecisive and demanded that he be sent back to Jaffna.Ã¢â‚¬Å“MGR told him to be patient and stay back in Delhi for further discussions,Ã¢â‚¬Â he had said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prabhakaran also said he could not endorse any agreement which kept the merger of the northern and eastern provinces temporary. He also said that no agreement should be signed without closure of all the military camps of Sri Lankan forces in the northern and eastern provinces. The meeting was inconclusive. I told Prabhakaran that this was the fourth time he was trying to embarrass the Prime Minister of India. I recalled that he had done this at Thimpu, again in August/ September 1985 and then again in Bangalore. I told Prabhakaran that he was being shown the final draft of the agreement, which he should study before taking a final decision.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was the assessment of Indian officials that Prabhakaran had changed his mind after the discussions held in Madras on his way to Delhi.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSource: The Hindu-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,OTHER,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=44466,7,,Not relevant,News

M. Withana said previously, the war had been the wall which hindered Sri Lankans from moving forward to develop the country and expose its wonders to other countries.Ã¢â‚¬Å“War puts peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives in misery, and distorts the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development. So, after it (the war) ended, the Sri Lankan people reclaimed their long lost freedom and they are not ever looking back. Freedom is so invaluable even money canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now that we have got our freedom, not only the power has been brought back to the Parliament but the people can now express their opinions in a democratic way,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told Bernama in a recent interview, in conjunction with Sri Lankan President Maithripala SirisenaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official visit to Malaysia.According to Withana, the Sri Lankan people are now more welcoming than before, hoping to attract more tourists to their US$3.5 billion tourism industry, which has been growing steadily at between 15% to 18% annually.He said after the war ended in 2009, the number of tourist arrivals had also been growing steadily from 400,000 to two million people, to date.Withana added that tourists could now explore every inch of Sri Lanka without having to worry about the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security, noting it was now one of the safest and secure countries in the region.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We want people to come to Sri Lanka and see that we have a lot to offer, ranging from Ceylon Tea, handloom products and Sri Lankan jewelleries. Let the investors step in.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sri Lanka is a compact country with great weather pattern all year round.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freeways are coming up, hotels are also being built ... lots of facilities are being refurbished,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said, adding that Malaysia was the first country to invest in Sri Lanka after the war ended.In a separate event, Withana told reporters the country planned to increase the number of Malaysian visitors to Sri Lanka to 50,000 next year.Ã¢â‚¬Å“And to achieve that target, Sri Lanka Tourism currently holds tourism promotional activities in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Malaysia, which started last Tuesday,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.The events include Sri Lanka Tourism Cultural Extravaganza at Berjaya Times Square, Food and Cultural Festival at InterContinental Hotel and tourism promotional campaign at Suria, KLCC here.Withana also said Sri Lanka Airlines and the Sri Lankan Tourism Board will organise a series of marketing activities to address the main markets in Malaysia, which has brought 25,000 Malaysian visitors to the island republic this year.He said Malaysians were spoilt for choice as Sri Lanka had 31 flights a week from Kuala Lumpur to Colombo, adding that the island republic could offer a lot of good attractions such as beaches, wildlife attractions, tea plantations, mountains and cultural diversities.

454,"The brazen invasion of Sri Lankan airspace by Indian Air Force jets and transport aircraft on June 4, 1987, enraged Sri Lankan army officers who were, at that time, doggedly and successfully carrying out Ã¢â‚¬Å“Operation LiberationÃ¢â‚¬Â against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the Vadamarachchi region of Jaffna peninsula.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was honestly, a terrible scene. My rage resurfaced; if we had any powerful anti-aircraft weapons in our possession, we would have not only shot down these aircraft but would have crushed them with a sledgehammer into smithereens and flushed them down the toilet,Ã¢â‚¬Â writes Maj.Gen.Kamal Gunaratne in his book Road to Nandikadal releasedhere on Tuesday.Ã¢â‚¬Å“We had no power or capability to shoot down the hooligans who were raping our airspace. We were all totally helpless and powerless against this violation. Great leaders in our presence like Brig. Kobbekaduwa and Col.Wimalaratne were equally powerless. There are no words sufficient to describe the anger, hatred, disgust and sadness which shot through my entire being. For all of us, it was a huge humiliation.Ã¢â‚¬ÂBlaming the non-equalitarian Indian social order for the way India was treating Sri Lanka, Gen.Gunaratne asks: Ã¢â‚¬Å“As a country which believes, promotes and maintains the caste system in its very social fabric, wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t this like treating Sri Lankan as Harijans (low caste people) by a bunch of Brahmins (high caste people)?Ã¢â‚¬ÂA further reason for dismay for Gen.Gunaratne and his comrades was the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to Sri Lanka.Though the Government of Sri Lanka took this matter up with the international community, no country took it seriously and the message conveyed by the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powers was: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ India is the regional power. Anything that happens in the region should not affect the Indian interests. Therefore work in collaboration with India.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe Sri Lankan government then decided to abort the Vadamarachchi operation which was then poised to progress into its second phase.But this did not stop the LTTE from continuing its aggression.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam could always quit the talks if these were unsatisfactory, I submitted. But my arguments fell on deaf ears.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“However, the real sting was in PrabhakaranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charge that I had betrayed him as Mahatthya (his Deputy) did earlier.

The youths with robust physique are without decent jobs. A sense of alienation has crept into their minds and hearts.This provided a fertile ground for recruitment of disgruntled youths unhappy with the living conditions in the island nation, the informed sources feel, adding, The purpose of the youth flocking to the faraway Australia may not be merely for the sake of jobs.Giving credence to this view, one of the illegal emigrants to Australia through the Prakasam coast laments while talking to The Hindu that, we are looked down upon as second class citizens in Sri Lanka. There is no chance for us to bag government contracts. We have to satisfy ourselves by executing sub-contracts that too after paying hefty bribes leaving us with little profit margin.The probe reveals that the traffickers have used satellite phones with Global Positioning System(GPS) to keep in touch with their counterparts in the high seas and also transported illegally Lankan Tamils to other countries such as Ireland, UK and Canada, the sources say, adding after facing the heat in neighbouring Tamil Nadu as also Puducherry. The human traffickers seem to have shifted their operations to Prakasam coast to transport illegal emigrants from Sri Lanka without hassles after landing in Chennai by air. The probe also revealed that at least 60 illegal emigrants had used the Prakasam coast in the past to reach their favourite destination overseas.

494,"Indias former Union Law Minister and advocate Ram Jethmalani has said that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was created by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for the protection of Indian interests.    Jethmalani also hit out at the India-Sri Lanka peace accord signed in 1987 stating that it was the great betrayal of Indian interest.    He said LTTE was created by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for the protection of Indian interests.    They were trained by our own agency RAW. When the Chinese and the Pakistanis were establishing their power in Sri Lanka, Indira wanted some force inside Sri Lanka to safeguard our Indian interests, he was quoted as saying by Indian media.    He also took a dig at Rajiv Gandhi blaming him of betraying Indian interest in the past.    He soon enough got involved in Bofors. And, it is the Bofors phase of his life that made him enter into a pact with Sri Lanka with a very fox-like politician called Jayawardene (former Sri Lankan President, Junius Richard Jayawardene) and I think that Indo-Ceylon pact that he entered into was a great betrayal of Indian interest. And, those who were treated as state guests and given training and money, they were exposed to be killed by Indian army which was sent to Sri Lanka. It certainly was betrayal and a case of great provocation, though within the meaning of penal code, it cannot be called grave and sudden provocation, he said.    Hailing Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa for taking the right decision to release former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis assassins, Jethmalani, opposing death sentence, said that delay exceeding two years in the execution of death sentence should be considered sufficient to invoke Article 21 and demand quashing of the sentence.    Speaking at a function where he was felicitated by MDMK chief Vaiko for saving the assassins from the gallows, Jethmalani complimented the Chief Minister for her decision to release the seven convicts and hoped she would stick to her decision. Hitting out at Congress for opposing the release of the convicts, he said some sycophants in Congress opposed the move for electoral gains.    Talking about Santhan, Murugan and Perarivalan, he said the trio had been living in the shadow of the noose for over 23 years. It was like undergoing 15 life sentences, Jethmalani said.    Quoting Justice O Chinappa Reddy, he said the judge in his verdict 50 years ago stated that any delay in carrying out the death sentence beyond two years should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21.    Justice Sadasivam just did what Justice Chinappa Reddy did 50 years ago, Jethmalani said hailing the judgement.    Jethmalani said he opposed death penalty and quoted British philosopher of law Jeremy Bentham that human justice is fallible.    He said the courts should not inflict sentences that are irrevocable and he is for the abolition of death sentence.    Jethmalani had appeared for the defence of three convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Santhan, Murugan and Perarivalan, in their plea against death sentence.

And has shown Sri Lanka as a country that got trapped in to providing them with the assets, as a result of the debt overtaking.

The minister was on a three-day tour of Kerala, leading a 12-member delegation to study the local government mechanism in the state and learn the role of women in local administration. The biggest takeaway for this delegation are lessons on women empowerment, says Musthapha. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have a lot to learn from Ã¢â‚¬ËœKudumbashreeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and your panchayat system.In your system, women have entered the local body administration. This has eradicated corruption and increased efficiency. In Sri Lanka, somehow, women have left matters of the state to the men. Women are hesitant to vote for women!

We have passed the bill and have to move forward from a male-dominated system,Ã¢â‚¬Â he tells Express.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The strength of the family is women. You have brought that strength to local bodies.

66,"Sri Lanka elected the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first female prime minister in 1960 but four decades later the island nation is still struggling to achieve equal representation for women in politics, the Wall Street Journal said in an article.Fresh electoral reforms, which include combining the proportional representation and first-past-the-post system, promised by its new government could be the answer to the female shortfall.Though womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights campaigners say the changes are not legally binding and fail to introduce a quota system, which they argue is essential to achieve equality in Parliament.In 1931, Sri Lanka became the first country in Asia to give women the vote.By 1960, Sirimavo Bandaranaike was appointed as the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sixth prime minister, the first woman in the role. She served three terms and retired from office at the age of 84. Her daughter, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, became Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first woman president in 1994 and completed two terms in power. After blazing a trail, albeit a dynastically driven one, female representation in wider Sri Lankan politics has remained abysmally low, say rightsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ advocates.In Parliament, the percentage of women hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gone above 6.5% since independence in 1948. Currently only 13 out of 225 parliamentary members are women Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just 5.8%.In provincial councils, womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representation has never exceeded 6%. For local councils, the statistics are even more dismal, with womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representation hovering between 1 to 2%.Slow progress in political empowerment has also damaged the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to bridge the gender gap. In 2014, Sri Lanka slipped 24 places in the global Gender Gap Index published by the World Economic Forum, despite scoring well on education and healthcare, ending up 79 out of 142 countries.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Transformation of the current political culture is crucial to create an environment in which women can equally run for political office,Ã¢â‚¬Â said gender rights activist Kumudini Samuels and director of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Women and Media Collective. Legally binding mandatory provisions for elected bodies and political parties that include compulsory nominations, closed lists and reserved seats have been successfully used worldwide to increase women representation, she argues.Over a 100 countries have used quota systems to raise political empowerment, including Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neighbours Pakistan and Afghanistan. But such reforms have received little attention from local legislators.Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s six-month old government is scrambling to push through electoral reforms in Parliament before calling for elections. Minority rights have received significant attention resulting in proposals to increase the present 225 seats in Parliament to 255 to accommodate more Tamil and Muslim legislators. But Ms. Samuels says little has been done to provide sufficient representation for women who make up 52% of Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 20 million population.The reform process to include women has also been criticised for lacking transparency, despite verbal support from both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya.Female representation is an issue that is usually dropped by the wayside, acknowledges Deputy Foreign Minister Ajith Perera.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Previous women political leaders were appointed because of the power of dynastic politics in Sri Lanka. Now we must look at how professional middle-class women can climb the ranks,Ã¢â‚¬Â Mr. Perera said. Perera was the only politician to propose a quota system but it has received little traction with political parties.Outside of politics women have done better. Female adult literacy levels have consistently hit 90% or higher with those in the 15-24 age bracket reaching 99%. Girls also outnumber boys in secondary education and 60% of undergraduates are women, according to the Census and Statistics Department.Even though women make up only 35.5% of the 8.8 million-strong labour force, many more are employed in the informal sector. Agriculture is the largest employer of women at 33.9% while 42% work in the services field and just under one in four women are engaged in industries. As many as 600,000 women employed as migrant workers earned US$6 billion in 2014, helping to make remittances the highest foreign exchange earner.The government says proposals to increase nominations and appoint women to non-elected seats of parliament have been included in the latest set of amendments. Yet these are not legally binding and only call on political parties to Ã¢â‚¬Å“considerÃ¢â‚¬Â women representatives.Ã¢â‚¬Å“These measures will allow more women to enter Parliament,Ã¢â‚¬Â said government spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Ã¢â‚¬Å“even the [male] MPs will be more enthusiastic to come to Parliament now,Ã¢â‚¬Â he quipped.",WOMEN,NOT RELEVANT,Neutral,Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=31102,89,,Women,News

Among identified issues that prevent women from participating in politics are the existing masculine political culture, existing policies that are disadvantages to women, lack of financial support available for women coming into politics, and limited opportunities to build capacity of women entering politics. To eradicate these impediments the young MPs suggest the need to include a quota system for women with a set representation; creating awareness and educating voters on the need to include more women representatives in Parliament; and initiating dialogues on the importance of such representation, as well as the need to mobilise the political leadership to support women.Elaborating further MP Vasantha Senanayake said There are 13 females in Sri Lanka parliament, which is less than 6%. Never in history has this dismally low percentage has exceeded. More qualified and professional women should be encouraged to come in to Parliament. A constitutional reform is needed for make it easier for women to contest. I have submitted a set of constitutional reforms to the Parliamentary Select Committee. It proposes 100 MPs to be elected based on the first pass the post system, on 100 redefined national constituencies, a further 100 to be elected on a preferential basis and 25 to be appointed on the national list, and all appointees of the national list to be women. MP Harin Fernando added that We believe that it is vital for women to take pro-active leadership when it comes to national issues and policies. We also believe that the support of women is essential in reconciliation activities, and are keen on engaging with the parliamentary women caucus to meet our group objectives as well. YPLFSL consists of a group of young cross-party parliamentarians covering various ethnicities and different electorates across the country, working towards a common goal to promote peace and reconciliation. They include MP Vasantha Senanayake (SLFP / Gampaha District), MP Shehan Semasinghe (SLFP / Anuradhapura District), MP Niroshan Perera (UNP / Puttalam District), MP Harin Fernando (UNP / Badulla District) MP Hunais Farook (All Ceylon Muslim Congress / Vanni District) and Raghu Balachandran  Political Activist (Tamil National Alliance).

Under the dedicated guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are committed to completing these initiatives in the coming year.To kick-start the International Day of the Disabled, observed on the 1st of December, we have organized special activities aimed at promoting the development of the differently abled individuals, just like any other segment of our society.

The Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ MovementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s selection of deserving candidates was said to have involved a number of anomalies. The opposition specifically alleged that the Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ initiative lacks a social empowerment system.The Social Welfare Board put the Ã¢â‚¬ËœAswesumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ scheme into effect as per President Ranil WickremesingheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s directives.The settlement program is a non-political, open process. Both appeals and objections may be submitted throughout the same process. It also covers the annual procedure of admitting the qualified and removing the ineligible.The President entrusted our Ministry with enlisting 1.2 million people into the productive economy in order to empower them. Before the end of this month, the President will get the relevant plan.The empowerment of this group will be accomplished during the course of the three-year strategy.In this country, there are 1.8 million Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ beneficiaries, and more than half of them are adults. Although they were engaged in various jobs when they were young, they joined the SamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Movement after the age of 60.That has also been the focus of the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention, and actions have been taken to implement the pension system with help from the Social Security Board. It will be submitted to the Cabinet in the future and the necessary work will be done.Education reforms are also crucial for the cause of social empowerment. The objective is to create skilled professionals. We are receiving support for this program from China, the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Banking System.As a result, rather than eradicating poverty in Sri Lanka, we have planned to exploit the Samurdhi Bank system to generate wealthy individuals.Currently, some politicians are working very hard to misrepresent Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bank. However, the Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamurdhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ economy and financial system are being promoted more vigorously thanks to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœAswesumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ program.Additionally, commencing from August 1st, those who could not apply for Ã¢â‚¬ËœAswesumaÃ¢â‚¬Â this year or failed to submit appeals will have another chance to do so. Every year, a certain number of people are eligible for these benefits, and some of them drop out due to a variety of reasons.Additionally, this program provides empowerment and protection to everyone, from young children to senior citizens.Instead of eradicating poverty, President Ranil Wickremesinghe wants to see Sri Lanka become a developed nation by 2048. This serves as the required context for that. A welfare state is not what we desire.

A campaign has been launched to provide the booster dose to the population above 20 years of age.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe Foreign Ministry stated that despite the pandemic, Sri Lanka has received several international accolades in the tourism industry including CNNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where to Travel in 2022Ã¢â‚¬Â; the Global Wellness Institute; Conde Nast Traveler 2021 ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice Awards as well as other endorsements received previously in 2019 by Lonely Planet and the National Geographic Travel.The Sri Lankan government looks forward to more tourists visiting Sri Lanka from Canada and elsewhere with the gradual normalization of travel globally, the statement continued.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is important to note that even though Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the country is making every endeavor to reinvigorate its economy this year, through the implementation of prudent policies. Food security and law & order are the topmost priorities of the Government, and the availability of all essentials is considered as a vital part of the GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functions.

Under this programme, police presence is being increased in all popular tourist destinations of the country with greater presence of women police officers in police stations.

316,"YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki apologized to the LGBTQ community but stood by the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s controversial decision last week not to take down videos containing homophobic harassment and racist slurs.Ã¢â‚¬Å“I know the decision we made was very hurtful to the LGBT community,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Wojcicki on stage at RecodeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Code Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Monday. Ã¢â‚¬Å“That was not our intention at all. I thought it was important to be upfront about that. We are really sorry about that.Ã¢â‚¬ÂWojcicki was referring to the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stance on videos from Steven Crowder, a prominent right-wing personality, containing homophobic and racist slurs toward Vox video journalist Carlos Maza, who flagged them to the company.The Google-owned company said last week that CrowderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s videos Ã¢â‚¬Å“donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t violate our policies.Ã¢â‚¬Â But one day later, YouTube said it would demonetize the videos so that Crowder canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make money off of ads for Ã¢â‚¬Å“continued egregious actions that have harmed the broader community.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe move was perplexing and has spurred backlash, including from within the company. The company has historically been very vocal in its support for gay rights and it came during LGBTQ Pride Month. It also happened the same week YouTube announced a new policy to ban white supremacist and deniers of well-documented atrocities such as the Holocaust from its platform. Wojcicki said that policy update was something the company had been Ã¢â‚¬Å“working on for months.Ã¢â‚¬ÂBut WojcickiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apology isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an about-face: She said she was aware of and agreed with the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision concerning the videos that Maza flagged. She added that YouTube doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“knee jerkÃ¢â‚¬Â in its response and that it needs to have policies that are enforced in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“consistent way.Ã¢â‚¬ÂMoreover, she said demonetizing Crowder wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a reversal in its stance.In retrospect, the company would have announced both the decision to not pull down the videos and the subsequent demonetization in one fell swoop, she conceded.During a Q&A following her on-stage interview, AxiosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ina Fried asked: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Are you really sorry for anything that happened to the LGBTQ community, or are you just sorry they were offended?Ã¢â‚¬ÂWojcicki stressed that Ã¢â‚¬Å“we are actually sorryÃ¢â‚¬Â and that the company Ã¢â‚¬Å“wants to support this community but from a policy standpoint, we need to be consistent.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“It was a hard week,Ã¢â‚¬Â Wojcicki said, adding that many changes made in the hate policy Ã¢â‚¬Å“will be really beneficial to the LGBTQ community.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“We will be taking down those videos,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said.Sources: CNN-Agencies",OTHER,NOT RELEVANT,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=55682,9,,LGBTQIA+,News

As countries near the end target date in September 2015, governments around the world are reviewing their progress towards achieving the MDGs in the last 15 years.The MDG Country Report is the third MDG review report produced by Sri Lanka. It is also the first report that covers the entire country, allowing comparison across the 25 districts and providing policy makers with information to identify and support regions lagging behind. It also analyses achievements and thematic areas requiring further attention.Speaking at the launch event, Harsha De Silva said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The government of Sri Lanka understands the need in building bridges, in integrating our society, and in Sri Lanka being a country of Sri Lankans. I hope that we can make further progress in integrating the differences within communities. We have to ensure that in our market framework there is social goodwill and economic justice. That is what we mean by a social market economy.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe Report, which was prepared by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, is a joint publication by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations in Sri Lanka. Its findings show that Sri Lanka has performed well against the MDGs overall, having already achieved or being on-track to achieve the majority of the goals and indicators.",NOT RELEVANT,NOT RELEVANT,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=30244,11,,Not relevant,News

366,"Scientists warn that the entire Himalayan region is highly vulnerable to tremors and the strong possibility of a major earthquake is always there.The massive earthquake that rattled Turkey and Syria has taken over 47,000 lives and left millions homeless. It is heart-wrenching to look at the visuals as people grieve over their lost family, friends and homes. Such major events often trigger the question if another earthquake awaits? Well, according experts Uttarakhand is prone to such major disaster anytime.Ã¢â‚¬Å“EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface comprises various plates that are constantly in motion. The Indian plate is moving about 5 cm per year, leading to accumulation of stress along the Himalayas increasing the possibility of a greater earthquake,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr N Purnachandra Rao, Chief Scientist, NGRI speaking to news agency ANI.He further added, Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve a strong network of 18 seismograph stations in Uttarakhand. The region referred to as the seismic gap between Himachal & western part of Nepal incl Uttarakhand is prone to earthquakes that might occur at any time.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬ËœGreat earthquakeÃ¢â‚¬Â in UttarakhandSpeaking to TOI, Rao said that a Ã¢â‚¬Å“great earthquakeÃ¢â‚¬Â is inevitable in the Uttarakhand region as a lot of stress is building up beneath the surface. However, one cannot predict the date or time of the earthquake, he further added.The magnitude of the disaster may depend on several factors like geographic area, population, construction quality and others. Rao also stated that an earthquake similar to magnitude of that like in Turkey is likely to occur but one cannot predict the exact date and time.Although the region falls over what is a called a seismic gap, the area under the earth is accumulating lot of tension and can only be released through an earthquake, reported TOI.Another earthquake in Himalaya?Last year, scientists said there is a strong possibility of a major earthquake in the Himalayan region. According to a report by news agency PTI, Senior Geophysicist of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Ajay Paul said the Himalayas have come into existence as a result of a collision between Indian and Eurasian plates.Due to constant pressure of the Eurasian plate on the Indian plate, strained energy accumulating under it keeps releasing itself from time to time in the form of earthquakes, Paul said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Occurrence of earthquakes due to accumulation of strained energy under the Himalayas is a normal and relentless process. The entire Himalayan region is highly vulnerable to tremors and the strong possibility of a major earthquake is always there,Ã¢â‚¬Â Paul said.Need to be earthquake readyIn the wake of the recent earthquake, Paul also underlined the need for better preparation to minimise the damage to life and property. The constructions should be earthquake resistant, people should be made aware of what can be done by way of preparations before earthquakes, at the time of their occurrence and after they have happened, Paul said.Mock drills should be conducted at least once every year, he said, adding that if these things are done, the damages by an earthquake can be reduced by 99.99 per cent.Source Ã¢â‚¬â€œ India.com-Agencies",NOT RELEVANT,NONE,NONE,NONE,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=88665,2,,Not relevant,News

369,"(Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies will express concern about the Ã¢â‚¬Å“deteriorating debt situationÃ¢â‚¬Â facing some vulnerable middle-income countries, and call on all official and private creditors to respond swiftly to requests for debt treatment.A draft of the G20 leadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ declaration seen by Reuters includes far stronger language about debt issues and acknowledges that the problems extend far beyond just the poorest nations.The draft stressed the importance of all official and private creditors participating in debt relief and shouldering a fair burden. But it did not mention China, which has been criticized by Western countries and international financial institutions for delaying debt restructuring efforts.The leaders said they would step up efforts to implement the Common Framework for debt treatments in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner,Ã¢â‚¬Â according to the draft.The framework was created by the G20 and the Paris Club of official creditors in late 2020 to help low-income countries weather the COVID-19 crisis. However, results have proven elusive and only three countries - Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia - have formally applied for debt treatment under the framework.G20 leaders also welcomed a debt agreement reached by ChadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creditors, and encouraged the timely conclusion of a debt treatment for Zambia by early 2023. They also encouraged the conclusion of a debt treatment for Ethiopia under an IMF-supported program.IMF and World Bank leaders, along with officials from the United States and other Western powers, have pushed unsuccessfully to expand the G20 framework to include vulnerable middle-income countries, but that effort has been blocked by China, now the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest sovereign creditor.The draft declaration acknowledges, for the first time, the severity of the debt problems facing middle-income countries, in what experts said was a clear reference to Sri Lanka, which reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF in early September but needs to get financing assurances from multiple creditors, including China and Japan, to secure disbursements.Source: Reuters--Agencies",OTHER,NONE,NONE,NONE,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=86169,10,,Other Ethnic groups,News

The Police have been alerted to the loss of these two T-56 weapons, now possessed by those protesters who fled with those weapons.In return, Army troops using minimum force after firing several shots in the air held some of those unruly violent elements who were inciting others too to harm Army personnel and the Police. However, Army personnel along with Policemen, not deterred by their cycle of violence brought the situation under control as of Wednesday (13) night with minimum force and took all precautionary security measures by dispersing those violent elements, awaiting to storm the Parliamentary complex.In view of escalation of violent acts, those protesters, intent on harming the Armed Forces or the public property are therefore earnestly urged to desist from all forms of violence immediately or be prepared to face consequences as members of the Armed Forces are legitimately empowered to exercise their force, if the situation deems necessary as security to the public property, key installations, vulnerable points and human lives, does fall within the purview of their responsibility.Ã¢â‚¬Â",NOT RELEVANT,NONE,NONE,NONE,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=83643,13,,Not relevant,News

65,"The representation of minor political parties with a geographically dispersed voter base will be affected by sticking to 225 MPs and by reducing the number of electorates to 125, CaFFE Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said.Thus 20th Amendment will adversely affect Muslim and Indian origin Tamil parties, and the JVP and the JHU as well, he said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Cabinet approval of a system that establishes an electoral system combining elements of First Past the Post and Proportional Representation systems is the first step in changing the current political culture. This is also what the people of this country had been demanding.However, it is impossible to stick to 225 MPs while assuring representation to all noteworthy political forces. That is why an increase of MPs to, 234 or 235, was included in even in the first draft of electoral reforms. Apart from assuring representation to minor parties, we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t increase female representation without an increase in the number of MPs.The draft which was approved, 225 MPs and 125 electorates, created three main problems. First, it will take a long time to complete delimitation, second, it will be impossible to establish multi member seats, and it will not be possible to assure representation for Sinhala community in the North and East. Meanwhile, Tamil and Muslim communities will have the same issue outside of North and the East.In the 1970s Sri Lanka increased the number of electorates to 160. From the first delimitation committee, established during colonial times, to the one established in the 1970s, all such institutions increased the number of electorates in Sri Lanka. However to implement the proposal approved by the Cabinet yesterday, we will have to reduce the electorates to 115 - 118 (to leave room for about nine multi- member seats). Even the UNP, who forwarded the proposal, will have to remove around 40-45 electoral organizers. Electorates in Badulla will be reduced to six, from nine. Meanwhile three seats in Galle, two in Matara, three to four from Kurunegala and two to four seats from Kegalle, Rathnapura, Anuradhapura and Kalutara will also need to be reduced. 11 seats in Jaffna will be reduced to five or six. Thus reducing 35 electorates across Sri Lanka is unacceptable.CaFFE believes that it is the responsibility of political parties, civil society organizations and citizenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collectives to make the proposal passed by the Cabinet much more people friendly. If not we will have to witness a defeat of the 20A in Parliament and the continuation of preferential voting system.If we do not want to see a Parliament with 142 MPs who have not passed O/L and with less than 5% of female representation, CaFFE believes that the Cabinet approved proposal should be expanded into a bill that assures representation of all,Ã¢â‚¬Â Tennakoon said in a statement.",NOT RELEVANT,MUSLIM,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=31187,13,,MUSLIM,News

Therefore, I invite all Sri Lankan citizens to join hands during this Hajj festival, and be united in a common cause to achieve our domestic, regional and global goals.As we celebrate this joyous Hajj festival, I wish to remind the present generation, as well as the elderly, on the importance of not passing on the burdens of hardship to our future peer groups. Instead, let us nurture them as a proud nation, one that is respected by the global community while ensuring sustainable happiness.May this Hajj be a source of happiness and joy for all, especially our Sri Lankan Islamic brothers and sisters, as well as the Muslims across the world!",OTHER,MUSLIM,Neutral,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=91600,6,,MUSLIM,News

United National Party (UNP) won one seat and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won three.There were five seats for the Batticaloa district. Hizbullah supported Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last Presidential election.When Rajapaksa lost the presidential election, Hizbullah lost the General Election. He then came in through the backdoor and begged our current President and received a parliamentary seat through the National List.With the pride in receiving a National List MP seat, he then harassed our supporters and set fire to their shops and houses.Then I went to Kattankudy to console our supporters. Zahran had also crawled into this. What am I to do about that?When a politician goes to a place with an issue like that, who knows who comes there?

319,"The MeToo movement has taken the social media platforms by storm, with women coming out and disclosing the incidents of sexual harassment they have faced.Now a woman alleges that a Sri Lankan cricketer once harassed her during one of the Indian Premier League (IPL) tournaments. Singer Chinmayi Sripaada uploaded an image of a note written by the woman, which described her ordeal during the incident. Chinmayi further updated that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“said girl will speak on anonymity to a journalistÃ¢â‚¬Â.Even though Chinmayi has claimed the cricketer to be Lasith Malinga, the woman, who is the alleged victim of the harassment, has not named anyone.Malinga, who has represented the IPL franchise Mumbai Indians (MI), has 154 wickets from 110 matches in the league. He is also the highest wicket-taker in the history of the IPL.Earlier, an Indian flight attendant accused former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga of harassing her at a Mumbai hotel.The flight attendant had described the whole incident on a Facebook post, which is no longer available. However, a screenshot of the Facebook post is doing the rounds.Ã¢â‚¬Å“My star struck colleague spotted Indian and Sri Lankan cricketers in the elevator of Hotel Juhu Centaur, Mumbai and decided to meet them in their room for autographs.

356,"(Reuters) - Qatar and France have brokered a deal with Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to deliver urgent medication to some 45 Israeli hostages held by the group in Gaza in return for humanitarian and medical aid for the most vulnerable civilians.The two countries said the aid would leave Qatar for Egypt on Wednesday before being taken across the Rafah border crossing.Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a statement the deal would mean Ã¢â‚¬Å“medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in the Gaza Strip, in the most affected and vulnerable areas, in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHe did not give details on how much aid or what aid would be delivered to civilians.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said two Qatari Air Force planes were to land on Wednesday in Egypt with medicines purchased in France based on an Israeli list.Earlier, Philippe Lalliot, head of FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign ministry crisis centre which organises aid efforts, said negotiations had been going on for weeks and the initial idea had come from the families of some of the Israeli hostages.Specific medical packages for several months, which were put together in France, would be delivered to each of the 45 hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross will coordinate on the ground.France still has three nationals held in Gaza, but none of them are in urgent need of medication, Lalliot said.Source: Reuters--Agencies",OTHER,MUSLIM,Positive,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=96464,2,,MUSLIM,News
460,"The en-masse expulsion of Muslims from Sri LankaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Northern Province by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in October-November 1990, was not Ã¢â‚¬Å“ethnic cleansingÃ¢â‚¬Â but a measure to Ã¢â‚¬Å“protectÃ¢â‚¬Â them, argues P. Ariyanenthiran, a former Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP from the Eastern District of Batticaloa. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It could not be described as ethnic cleansing because it was to be temporary. The Muslims were told that they would be allowed to come back after the successful conclusion of the war for a separate Tamil Eelam. The properties and personal effects seized from the Muslims were to be kept safely and given back on their return. But this did not happen because the struggle for Tamil Eelam failed and the seized properties fell into the hands of the government forces,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ariyanenthiran told Express.On the demand of TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran that the Northern Provincial Council should apologise to the Muslims through a resolution, he said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no need to apologise now because, in the course of the war, the LTTE had publicly apologised and said that the Muslims could come back.Ã¢â‚¬ÂExplaining the background to the expulsion of 75,000 to 90,000 Muslims from the six districts of the Northern Province, Ariyanenthiran said that Muslims were asked to quit en masse Ã¢â‚¬Å“for their own protectionÃ¢â‚¬Â in view of the anti-Tamil activities of Muslims in the Eastern Province at the instigation of the Sri Lankan government and military. Muslims were being used as spies. The Sinhalese-Muslim Home Guards killed Tamils. Army-sponsored units like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Green TigersÃ¢â‚¬Â terrorised Tamils, he claimed.Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) leader V. Anandasangaree said that it is wrong to ask the entire Tamil community to apologise for the doings of the LTTE. According to him, Northern Tamils had no problem with the Muslims, and if they did not protest at that time, it was because they were scared of the LTTE.Source: The New Indian Express",OTHER,MUSLIM,Negative,Non-Discriminative,,,,,,,https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=32943,16,,MUSLIM,News
