"As Sri Lanka's economic and political crisis deepens, the government has proposed a new Employment Act that would reform 13 existing labor laws. This means extending working hours, eliminating unfair dismissal protections, and limiting union and collective bargaining rights. There are also concerns that the process of reforming labor laws is community-centered and democratic. Specially avoiding the labor advisory council established by the government and resorting to these reforms raises questions about the democratic nature of the process. This reform will further worsen the plight of workers, worsened by the pandemic and the economic crisis. These are some of the ideas presented in this regard.

"The case against HRD and Mayan Q'eqchi community journalist Carlos Ernesto Choc Chub and three artisanal fishermen for the crime of illegal detentions was dismissed yesterday.

In a seven year struggle, the journalist faced digital attacks, threats, raids on his home, and judicial harassment on fabricated charges by mining company CGN-PRONICO, where he was accused of instigation to commit a crime, unlawful association, unlawful assembly and demonstrations, and damages and illegal detentions of four employees of Compañía Guatemalteca de Níquel SA.

These accusations followed his investigation and documentation of the pollution of Lake Izabal and the coverage of a protest by Maya Q'eqchi' communities and artisanal fishermen, where fisherman Carlos Maaz was killed in 2017.

While Front Line Defenders welcomes the conclusion, it condemns Carlos Ernesto Choc’s prosecution and Guatemala’s context of criminalisation and harassment against community journalists and HRDs.

Today, we gathered to remember his legacy and honor his contributions by offering flowers at the memorial statue. 

Dr. Tiruchelvam was a legal visionary and a committed advocate of human rights and the rule of law. He believed that the law could and should be an instrument to secure civil rights, social and economic justice and that development should prioritise uplifting people’s lives.

He believed that ethno-religious pluralism and diversity should be celebrated rather than be suppressed. He studied political and other arrangements across the world, seeking inspiration and examples that provided for unity in diversity.

Law and Society Trust was founded by Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam in June of 1982. He was a director of both the Law & Society Trust (LST) and the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES), and a Senior Partner of Tiruchelvam Associates — a leading law firm in Sri Lanka.

Dr Tiruchelvam was assassinated by a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suicide bomber in July 1999.

We invite you to an exhibition to mark 40 years since the heinous events of July 1983, and the various manifestations of political violence that have scarred our contemporary history. This group exhibition by six Sri Lankan artists will be held at the JDA Perera Gallery, Horton Place. 

Curated by Chandraguptha Thenuwara, the exhibition is an attempt to understand the impact of Sri Lanka's tumultuous history of political violence and injustice and the issues that persist unresolved to date in various parts of the island. 

The exhibition includes work reflecting personal journeys and commentary on surviving the war in Mullivaikal; experiencing the violence of Digana, lives and struggles of the Malaiyaha Tamils; gender biases in marginalised narratives; the loss of freedoms; and reflections on our contemporary triumphs, struggles, aspirations and fragilities.

International IDEA, Perludem, Bersih and Tindak Malaysia had jointly organized the roundtable with the objectives of identifying various forms and ways of the occurrence of malapportionment and gerrymandering in the countries in Asia-Pacific region and learning from each other good boundary delimitation practices, thus preventing malapportionment and gerrymandering. It was also expected to elaborate any possible recommendation to tackle malapportionment and gerrymandering issues and to discuss the role of election technology like ERA in promoting sound boundary delimitation processes in accordance with international principles and best practices. 

30 participants representing all major democracies in Asia-Pacific attended the programs. Mr.D.M.

"On 2nd February, HRD Oleg Orlov was labeled a foreign agent by the Ministry of Justice for opposing Russia’s war in Ukraine. This occured at the same time as an ongoing investigation, where he and his lawyer were given a severely limited time-frame to study the case file with several investigation documents. The renewed investigation follows Orlov's alleged “public actions aimed at discrediting the use of Russian Federation armed forces to protect the interests of the Russian Federation.”

Orlov is a prominent human rights defender and council member of HRDC ""Memorial,"" and has a long history of advocating for human rights. He  was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2009.  His recent legal challenges and foreign agent designation raise concerns about the targeting of human rights defenders in Russia.

We emphasized the positive transformations in their lives, including advancements in Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) and efforts to combat discrimination and violence. 

A highlight of this Symposium was the presentation of the Policy briefs by Dr. Ramani Jayatilaka, based on the three action researches conducted on Single Women, Deserted Women and Female Sex workers by Centre for Women’s Research (CENWOR).

Women’s rights groups in Sri Lanka reject the current debt restructuring solutions that place the burden of repayment on Sri Lanka’s working classes, particularly its women. They are demanding urgent and sustainable solutions to the ongoing debt crisis in Sri Lanka, that respond to the actual lived experiences, struggles and needs of the people. 

At the ‘National Convening on Debt and Women’s Human Rights’ held in Colombo on 9-10 August 2023, women’s rights groups from Sri Lanka and other Asian countries discussed the ways the ongoing crisis has impacted their lives and the inadequacy of government solutions to respond in meaningful ways. They also severely criticised the historical and current roles played by international financial institutions mainly the World Bank and IMF in imposing unjust austerity measures and their lack of accountability in worsening economic crises in the region. 

Sri Lanka is currently going through a crippling economic crisis because of an unsustainable debt burden of 103.8% of GDP as of March 2023. This crisis hit households at a time when many had not yet recovered from the shocks of COVID-19. The government response of austerity measures to secure an International Monetary Fund bailout are being hurriedly rolled out, with no public consultation. This has included cuts in public spending, steep increases in utility tariffs, food and energy costs, indirect and regressive taxation, limited cash handouts as social security. 

This has particularly impacted low to middle income families, and labour laws that threaten to rollback gains in wage and job security, especially for women. Critically, the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to use the earnings of the Employee Provident Funds to repay Sri Lanka’s debt - forcing Sri Lanka’s working class to bear the burden of repaying the wealthiest creditors - and has blocked resistance and legal challenges to the same. 

“The social security funds of workers are being compromised to pay the debt for the richest income earners in the world. The government has decided to trade off the savings - for many of them this is the only savings - of some of the most hardworking people in Sri Lanka,” said lawyer and activist, Lakmali Hemachandra. “There are severe violations going on with the domestic debt restructuring. The restructuring process is due to finish in September and by that time, workers will lose the security of their savings. We need the international community to hear and condemn the fact that creditors are being paid with workers' savings and the Government and IMF is continuing to hold the position that there is people’s buy-in for this. There is no people's buy-in, people just don’t have a way to communicate that,” Hemachandra said.

The Convening reaffirmed that women are disproportionately affected by both the economic crisis and current state solutions to restructure the debt. Due to their unpaid caregiving roles at household level, women often shoulder responsibilities of ensuring families are fed, looked after and educated, even as they face falling wages, rising food, electricity and water bills, precarious and informal employment and lack of access to meaningful social security. “Households can only meet their basic food needs by taking daily loans, weekly loans and other borrowing at very high interest rates. We cannot manage basic needs with our income anymore. How is this fair?” said Suganya Kandeepan, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice.     

Social security is not charity but a human right of all people. Women’s groups are demanding that universal social security in this time of crisis be made binding and enforceable by law. Without meaningful expansion of social safety nets and increasing fiscal allocation, targeted schemes like Aswesuma will not benefit the millions of families hit hard by the crisis. “In order to fund universal social security, we demand the government start taxing the rich, taxing corporations and reduce regressive consumer taxes like VAT with immediate effect, and expand budgetary allocation for social security beyond the current limit of 0.6% of GDP. We need to also expand social security to include other forms of support to relieve stress on household debt: guaranteed days of work, weekly nutritional food basket, health and education support, and transport support.” - Sarala Emmanuel, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice. 

Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, Former UN Independent Expert on Debt and Human Rights said, “We also need to question why only domestic creditors have been asked by the government to make a sacrifice and accept, to some extent, a haircut in their credit. External debt holders should also be asked to make a similar contribution to bring sovereign debt to a sustainable level. According to international law, in the Sri Lankan context, prohibition of discrimination means inter-creditor equity in sovereign debt restructuring.”

Sri Lanka is one of several countries in Asia and the Pacific currently grappling with the impacts of a debt crisis. Women’s rights groups across Asia Pacific have expressed solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka, with Regional Coordinator of APWLD Misun Woo saying, “It is outrageous to hear countless similar stories of violence women go through in a debt crisis.  Women’s stories across Asia and the Pacific confirm that there is a ‘debt formula’ which is a clear manifestation of neo colonialism and imperialism that takes away peoples’ life, dignity and sovereign power.  APWLD stands in solidarity with women and peoples of Sri Lanka and joins your struggles for justice and freedom. “

The national convening was co-organised by the Law & Society Trust (LST), NAFSO Sri Lanka, Women and Media Collective (WMC), Colombo Urban Lab, The Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD). Participants included representatives from groups of labour activists, trade unions, rural and urban women, academia, and civil society from Sri Lanka and Asia.

On 22nd January 2024 the Law and Society Trust (LST) petitioned the Supreme Court to determine that specific provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Bill violate the constitution and if enacted will do “grave and irreparable injury” to the people.
LST maintains that provisions of the Bill violate in general the inalienable rights of persons as well as specific rights of citizens.
The Bill violates the sovereignty of the People (Article 3); the legislative powers of the People (Article 4 (a)); the judicial powers of the People (Article 4 (c)); and a range of fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. 

Specifically, the Bill violates the people’s rights to the freedom of thought (Article 10), freedom from torture (Article 11); the right to equality (Article 12(1)); freedom from arbitrary arrest (Article 13 (1), the right to due process when arrested (Article 13(2), the right to be heard at a fair trial (Article 13 (3)), and the right to the presumption of innocence (Article 13 (5)).

The Bill also undermines the rights of citizens to freedom of speech, assembly, association and movement, freedom of belief and worship, freedom of culture, of occupation and business and freedom to move and choose residence. 

The petition reminds Parliament that “it shall not abdicate or alienate its legislative powers “ (Article 76(1) and must pass laws that are aligned to the constitution.

This Bill has overbroad definitions of what constitutes terrorism. It includes a range of illegal acts and omissions which may have little to do with terrorism. It provides for administrative detentions and undermines judicial oversight.  It provides overly broad powers of investigative powers and empowers the Attorney General to unfairly cause suspects to bear penalties. It gives the President extraordinary powers to proscribe organisations as terrorist organisations, designate places as prohibited places. The Bill violates many human rights and  is not aligned with international standards. 

We reiterate that this Bill if enacted will do “grave and irreparable injury” to the fundamental rights of the people and future generations, and to the fabric of democracy in Sri Lanka.

The Law and Society Trust press briefing to discuss ‘The Budget and Education during the Time of Covid’

LST invited three academics to share their perspectives to inform the public. 

The pandemic has devastated Sri Lanka’s society and the economy. The Budget for 2022 drafted in the context of the pandemic finally recognizes the severity of the economic crisis as one of the worst in the history of the country and the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech identified the systemic character of this crisis and the structural problems of the economy reaching back over the decades. While the diagnosis of the crisis is correct, the solutions put forward in the Budget are flawed and the priorities misplaced. 

The Government’s revenues in 2020 and 2021 are abysmally low and on the order of 9% of GDP mainly due to the tax cuts introduced soon after President Rajapaksa came to power. 

Indeed, Sri Lanka has comparatively spent very little on Covid-19 relief for the marginalised sections of society in 2020 compared to most countries; Sri Lanka’s COVID relief is lower than 0.5% of GDP. 

Dr. Ahilan Kadirgamar claims the Budget plans to raise revenue to 12.3% of GDP but the measures proposed are unconvincing, and it is uncertain if the proposed Budget proposals will be implemented at all. He was of the view that Sri Lanka should eventually target revenues above 25% of GDP and he advised that measures such as a wealth tax are needed to raise Government revenue during a time when incomes are falling.

Much of the Government spending is focused on infrastructure and populist measures of hand outs to rural constituencies. Neither are going to get the country out of the crisis. A country like Sri Lanka cannot stimulate itself out of the economic crisis through infrastructure spending. 

In the budget there are no measures to mobilise the rural economy with appropriate investment and programmes. For example, the crucial sectors of fisheries and livestock important for milk production have only been allocated Rs. 1 billion each.  In past years the imports for these sectors have been on the order of Rs. 40 billion (USD 200 million) and Rs. 60 billion (USD 200 million) respectively. These are foreign exchange expenditures that the country cannot afford today.

When it comes to the education sector both the diagnosis of the problem and the solutions are flawed. The Government is repeating past programs of trying to extract revenue through education by for example inviting foreign students and fee levying institutions. 

Dr. Kaushalya Perera noted that a large part of the government’s plan for the future seems to be based on current and expected loans and grants from the “bilateral and multilateral agencies”.

The Minister of Finance states in his maiden budget speech stated that the government works “closely” with these agencies. Primary to tertiary education is funded by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the Kuwait Fund, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), India, Saudi Arabia, the European Union through ERASMUS funds, Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) through primarily the Ministry of Education and indirectly through the State Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational Education, Research & Innovations as well as State Ministry of Women and Child Development, Pre-Schools & Primary Education, School Infrastructure & Education Services.

These are ongoing projects, lasting approximately 2-3 years more, and the total value is USD 250 million. Due to various issues both country internal and related to matters between donor agencies, the World Bank remains the main lender and is the driving force of policy in education in Sri Lanka. Therefore, our education policies have been and will continue to have an emphasis on what the World Bank considers important: technological advances, infrastructure development which is interpreted as what a better learning environment is, and on training to be a tech-savvy workforce. This is apparent in the budget documents, and the budget speech as well. When the government decides to fund education mainly through foreign investments, when the larger portion of it is in the form of loans, where the conditions are already set, there is no space to suddenly shift away and start thinking of the needs of the country at this point. 

Dr Sharmala Kumar noted considering the multiple crises that we face generally as well as with respect to education, these plans should then provide an answer or response to addressing these crises. 

A primary concern for local communities and families was that the state should provide education during the Covid period that is responsive to their daily concerns and provides them with a semblance of safety and security. As a result of the pandemic, families were faced with mounting financial worries and even the midday meals that some children relied on were no longer available. The social network that protected students when their home environment was less than ideal through teachers and schools was lost during the pandemic. Finally, the strain of the pandemic and the isolation caused by social distancing is associated with a range of mental health concerns for students and their families. 

The Pandemic also revealed the problems that chronic underfunding and disinvestment of education had created for students, families, and teachers. The momentum that was built and the wide support that the teachers’ trade union action garnered is evidence of this.  The pandemic highlighted the vast disparities in education and, more broadly, society. A majority of the students and many teachers were completely disengaged from the online delivery of teaching that had become the only national policy on education. UNICEF reports that we have over 75% of our population without access to the internet. It also revealed that the system was unable to respond to the needs of a society ravaged by a pandemic. The budget appears to suggest no significant or systematic response at all. What would have been appropriate is a transformation of education, drawing of the issues that have been highlighted by teachers, farmers, and the public in general, that integrates education to a national solution to the problems that face us in 2022.

"At the meeting between members of the Tamil Diaspora group, the Global Tamil Forum and the president, he had assured the group of his support to their efforts to promote peacebuilding and reconciliation. This assurance would give reassurance to those who are like-minded that their work has the blessings of the country’s highest political authority. However, there is no getting away from the need for the political leadership to put its shoulder to the wheel rather than leave it to others to perform the Sisyphean task of pushing the boulder up the mountain. The government needs to give the political leadership to set up the institutions of state power and construct methods of ensuring justice which are embedded in the law.

For the past three years the Tamil farmers and herdsmen in Batticaloa have been complaining that the grazing land on which their cattle find fodder are being taken over for cultivating corn by Sinhala settlers. It is said that the grazing land was allocated by the government in a cabinet decision in 2011. However, since 2020, Sinhala settlers from Polonnaruwa have been annexing the pasture for corn cultivation. The conflicting permissions have caused tensions. Former Vice Chancellor of Eastern University, Prof Thangamuthu Jayasingam who now practices a lawyer for the Tamil farmers has confirmed that more than 80 cattle have been stolen, slaughtered or electrocuted on the ground since the visit of the president to Batticaloa two months ago. The total loss is said to be around 160 cattle. He has stated that “This unjust situation runs amidst and despite the establishment of two police posts, around October 7, 2023, just before the visit by the Honorable President to Batticaloa, and his declaration on 8th October 2023, to provide justice to these people at Chenkaladi.”

A similar unsettled situation on the ground exists in the north as well where the president ordered an end to the takeover of land on the basis that ancient Buddhist archaeological remains have been discovered in various places. When the words of the President, the highest executive, are not met with deeds on the ground the people will invariably lose faith in the system. Further when the orders of the court of law also are not implemented, and the police fail to act, they lose faith entirely. It is in such situations that violence emerges. Words need to be followed by deeds, or the spirit of goodwill and reconciliation that is in the air will not bring a solution to the problems on Ground Zero. The gazetting of the grazing areas by a presidential directive as per the 2011 cabinet paper may be a start to reconcile.

This collaborative initiative with JA was spearheaded by IESC’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusivity, and Accessibility (DEIA) committee.

Volunteer business coaches helped teams of sophomore-year students think through real-world business cases by listening to and refining solution ideas, planning presentation content, and providing tips to enhance delivery skills; and 2. Volunteer business coaches observed the best presentations, critically evaluated solutions, offered constructive feedback, and selected the winning team.

"Atekeh Rajabi, a woman human rights defender and former primary school teacher, was released from prison two days ago after having served two months of a six-month prison sentence on trumped up charges against her as retaliation for her human rights work in Iran. 

Since the September 2022 protests in Iran, she has been vocal about teachers’ rights, prisoners’ rights and violence against young protestors, especially the poisoning of school girls in Iran.

She had been sentenced by Branch 7 of Mashhad Revolutionary Court for “propaganda activities against the state” in a sentence upheld by Branch 35 of Khorasan Court of Appeals, which chose to implement the first two months and to suspend the remaining four months for a period of five years, on condition that Rajabi does not commit a criminal act during this period.

We urge the Iranian authorities to cease targeting defenders and guarantee their human rights without fear of reprisal and free of all restrictions, including judicial harassment.

"🌿🌍Hajrija Čobo,  environmental woman rights defender from Bosnia and Herzegovina, is facing a defamation lawsuit filed by a British mining company. In her fight to protect forests and rivers threatened by the company's ore exploration, she has been accused of spreading false information, facing demands for compensation.

An elementary and secondary school teacher by profession, Hajrija Čobo fights against corruption and the destruction of the environment as a representative of NGG Park prirode Trstionica i Boriva, an informal grassroots group of local activists. The defamation lawsuit directly targets her for speaking out against the mining company's activities. She has spoken out about water contamination, health problems posed by the polluted water, deforestation, habitat loss and unethical conduct. Despite receiving threats and attempts to silence her, Hajrija has kept carrying her peaceful defense of human rights.

📢Front Line Defenders calls on the Adriatic Metals BH d.o.o to cease their targeting of Hajrija, and immediately withdraw the lawsuit. We urge the authorities to dismiss the court proceedings, ensuring a safe environment for all human rights defenders.

The verdict (which was issued in her absence during a trial on 19 December 2023 and communicated to her two days ago) also imposes a two-year ban on residing in Tehran province, a two-year travel ban, a two-year prohibition on membership in social-political groups, and a two-year restriction on using a smartphone. These charges are the latest addition to a total of five convictions that she has faced since March 2021, which amount to over a decade in prison and 154 lashes, among other reprisals.

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns the continuous sentencing of Iranian WHRD Narges Mohammadi, who has long been unjustly imprisoned for her peaceful work in defense of justice and freedom for women in Iran. She has been arrested a total of 13 times, and her sentences amount to more than 30 years in prison and 154 lashes.

Facing unjust charges for voicing concerns about women's human rights and the total abortion ban, Vanessa has endured a three-year-long legal battle, impacting her vital work defending human rights.

While acknowledging this victory, we stand firm in demanding the Andorran authorities recognize the legitimacy of human rights work to ensure Vanessa and other defenders can advocate for safe and legal abortion without intimidation or fear of reprisals.

We urge the Andorran authorities to stop using defamation laws with the purpose of inhibiting criticism of public officials, to align with international human rights standards, and to ensure access to safe and legal abortion in Andorra, the only country in Europe with a total ban on abortion.

The T-FAST project works to strengthen public and private institutions linked to international trade, ensuring the success of trade facilitation in Paraguay.  

Since the launch of the T-FAST project in 2019, technical assistance and support have improved and facilitated Customs’ processes and procedures through the National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) working groups. The success of Paraguay’s Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) program highlights T-FAST’s work with Customs. Paraguay’s AEO program now serves as a regional benchmark and improved standard of trade facilitation. The AEO Program is open to the entire logistics chain, an example of collaboration by public institutions linked to foreign trade. To date, eighteen operators have been certified, and ten additional operators are in the certification process. #USDA #TFAST",None,Positive,Non Discriminative,,Social Media
"Human rights defender Mehdi Mahmoudian was released from Evin prison two days ago. He was detained since August 2021, when he was arrested and sentenced to prison in multiple cases for his human rights work. The cases relate to gathering to commemorate the victims of the downing of the Ukrainian airliner PS752 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corpse (which killed 176 civil passengers on board), for defending the right to health in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and for his advocacy against the death penalty.

His release occurred on the fourth anniversary of the downing of the PS752. While those responsible have not been held accountable, Iranian authorities prosecuted human rights defenders such as Mehdi Mahmoudian and Bahareh Hedayat.

Front Line Defenders calls on the Iranian government to guarantee, in all circumstances, that human rights defenders in Iran are able to carry out their legitimate human rights work without fear of reprisals.

In our referenced submission, we documented at least 35 HRDs in China sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1-14 years between November 2018 [China's last UPR] and June 2023.

Here are some of our key recommendations referenced:

➡️China should accept and schedule outstanding requests for country visits by special procedures mandate holders, such as the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders. These visits should have independent, safe and unfettered access standards that also guarantee confidential and unsupervised meetings with independent HRDs without reprisals.

➡️China should initiate a transparent and consultative legal reform process to review existing laws and regulations and align them to international human rights norms and standards.

➡️China should release all HRDs detained for their legitimate human rights work and cease all forms of intimidation, harassment, and undue restrictions against HRDs and their families, ensuring impartial investigations that hold perpetrators accountable.

"Gender Equality and Empowerment of women and girls is essential to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In fact, it’s the core to achieving SDGs. Empowering women and girls has to be in a holistic approach where not only women and girls but also men and boys are involved. Educating, Engaging and finally empowering men and boys to support women and girls will make the efforts more effective, sustaining, and impactful. 

As a means of getting men involved in a holistic empowerment effort for women, we have launched one of our strategic programs called the ‘’Dear Father Program’’ in partnership with the Rotary Club of Colombo Uptown and Department of Samurdhi Development. 

This is a national-level initiative launched to convert men as allies and to help men better integrate into the family fabric to fight against the emerging ‘’Fatherlessness (Noninvolvement of Fathers)’’ in our society.  This took us over 18 months of preparation time and the invaluable guidance provided by many government and UN organizations. A tri-party MOU signed on 8th November 2023 at the Department of Samurdhi Development, Battaramulla Head Office, marked the launching of this strategically important program. This is expected to make a positive impact on bridging the inequality index and to make a positive impact on Sri Lanka’s socio-economic development efforts.

"Violence against women is a crime. It’s a human rights violation. Given the current socio-economic situation, we see a rise in the numbers and incidents. We need to create awareness in society. 

Dependencies create vulnerabilities for women. The most common form of reported violence is controlling behavior (19.1%). This indicates less power for women in making decisions and putting them into action. The second most common is physical violence (18.9%). 

The Women’s Wellbeing survey (2019) also revealed that 1 in 5 women in Sri Lanka have experienced sexual and/or physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime; and 1 in 4 women have experienced sexual and/or physical violence since the age of 15 by a partner or non-partner.  Also, a study conducted by UNFPA in 2019, revealed that over 90% of SL women and girls have faced sexual harassment in public buses and trains at least once in their lifetime.  

In a society where women and girls are not safe, society itself will deteriorate. Therefore don’t look away. You must create awareness, say no, and take action to prevent this pandemic from destroying our society.

"Message from SLCDF's Chairman 

AYUBOWAN
GREETINGS FROM SLCDF

We believe you have stayed safe at home, a new experience. Coming back to “NORMAL” is going to be another experience. COVID-19 has made a distinct impact on all of US. While we slowly recover to the so called “normal” state, it will be good to recall what existed before the COVID breakdown, and what we experienced during the last two months of “lockdown”.

What is this “normal state” that we are seeking to achieve? COVID affected us directly and indirectly in many ways.

For many of us the normal activity that sustained our livelihood was affected. This would have been a great blow to our sustenance and survival, but despite the disruption we have managed the situation for two months. It is of no benefit to blame anybody or COVID, for the situation, as that will not rectify the situation. Instead it would be much more profitable to recall how we survived through the two months to ensure that we will not suffer again in the future.

If you managed through the donations of “well-wishers”, it would not continue after “normalization”. Could you go back to what you were doing before? Would that source be available? Many questions will be in your mind. Whatever it may be, the end result is definitely going to be different from what it was. It is this realization and how we will cope with this new situation that will be the most important aspect for the future.

COVID provided us direct experiences that are related to the environment, health and social concerns.

In the environment area, COVID showed us how bad our air quality had been. Across the world, including Sri Lanka, the air quality improved immensely. According to the National Building Research Authority in Sri Lanka, the quality change was 70% reduction in pollution. We have been breathing dirt, no wonder we were sick!!! The question is do we want to go back to that situation again, to breath poison???

It would have made you realize how “consumptive” you were. All the stuff that was consumed before the lock down was not available in quantity and in some situations totally. But we have survived. We have learnt through experience the whole concept of “SUSTAINABILITY” – living within the means of availability. If you recall seriously, you will realize that we did have all our NEEDS, but not many or any of our WANTS. The production levels decreased, the demands changed, it is true the producers would have been affected in term of their income, but that would have proportionately affected their consumptive life too. The bottom line every body survived at a LOWER LEVEL of PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION. Within the so called “foot print” of the planet, much healthier and with less future worries!

COVID has clearly taught us that we cannot continue to destroy nature or mess with it. Since 1940, there have been over 335 Emerging Infections of this nature, but fortunately they were not as devastating as COVID-19. All of these have been shown to have been because of our interference with nature. If we continue with the interference, along with the increasing human numbers, there definitely will be more “covids” to come. DO WE WANT THAT?

The global impact of the COVID, has shown us very clearly how even all the best hospital facilities cannot prevent death on entering a hospital, the stark social inequalities among the rich and poor. The poor, unemployed in the developed world came in vehicles for their free food rations. We provided it to the house hold, despite the numbers developing countries have shown a great resilience in comparison to the developed world. What is the secret???

There are many more similar experiences of the environment, while the social concerns are no different. The COVID has resurfaced our family, social obligations and country commitments. We have come to realize the importance of self-sustenance. We have come to recognize the need to grow our own food in the backyard. To share what we all have. These great practices were slowly fading off from our society, COVID has resurfaced them and their values recognized. We have to keep them and develop them further to ensure that we use them for the benefit of the society at large. We at SLCDF value these principles, as our future will be based on these principles.

The impact of the COVID-19 will not leave us for some time. It will hound us for a long time and affect our activities. This is the stark reality, the bitter truth. SLCDF will however, be with you, our efforts will treble, and continue. Our present response though meagre is done with good faith and within the present capacity. We hope to follow up with more in the future.

Follow all health advice and commit to be more environmentally friendly in the future. Stay safe, be safe.

"Hoof care is critical to cow health and can reduce the cow’s potential for lameness, which impacts milk production. Sri Lanka’s Large Dairy Farm Association (LDFA) members and the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) requested assistance to gain technical knowledge on best practices in hoof care management. In response, the United States Department of Agriculture Food for Progress funded Market-Oriented Dairy (MOD) project, implemented by Improving Economies for Stronger Communities (IESC), invited Pieter Kloosterman, a world-renowned Dutch trainer and researcher on hoof trimming and hoof health, to the country to impart his knowledge and skills to large farms. In two trips to Sri Lanka, Mr. Kloosterman trained a total of 54 large farm and DAPH staff on the Dutch five-step hoof trimming method through classroom instruction and hands-on application. These trainees will develop hoof care guidance training for other small- and medium-scale dairy farms and establish a national hoof trimming license course to create a pool of certified hoof trimmers in the country.",None,None,None,,Social Media

"Nasim Soltanbeygi, a women's rights defender and journalist in Iran, has started serving a three-year and seven-month prison sentence, facing charges of ""gathering and colluding against national security"" and ""propaganda against the state."" This unjust verdict includes a two-year travel ban and a two-year ban on political or social group membership. Nasim's appeal, submitted in August, is now with Branch 36 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court.

Nasim has been a steadfast advocate for women's rights and freedom of expression, facing arrests and imprisonment for her activism since 2006. Despite being arbitrarily detained in the context of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests and released on bail earlier this year, the harassment continued, culminating in this severe sentence. 

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns this judicial harassment and believes her case is illustrative of Iran’s treatment of human rights defenders, where hundreds of human rights defenders have been arrested, charged and subjected to hefty prison sentences without adherence to due process or fair trials and excluded from general public amnesty.

"The pandemic COVID-19 lock down has immensely affected those living on the marginal lines of poverty comprising the vulnerable sector of society.

European Union has approved budget allocation for 2,713 families to be provided with dry rations @ Rs.1,500 each (Total Rs.4,069,500) for Delthota and Kandawalai DSDs and Kandy and Kilinochchi districts respectively.

EU funded OCEAN project location, Kandawalai DSD was identified as one such area badly affected by the pandemic. SLCDF through the generous funding of the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives provided 1,200 families belonging to 16 GNDs of the Kandawalai DSD with dry rations sufficient for two weeks at the cost of Rs.1500 (1200 families x Rs.1500/- = Rs.1.8 Million). These families earning 90% of their income from daily labour and agriculture and members of their families include persons with disabilities, Women headed households and some with many children, have now become helpless and dwindling in need.

We are grateful to the European Union for this generous contribution of Rs. 4.7 Million and thank the Kandawalai Divisional Secretary and staff, Civil Society Forum and SLCDF staff for their tireless support. We would also like to render our gratitude towards the entire of staff of the Kandawalai DS office for their hard work in identifying respective needy families, packing the goods and distributing them at this crucial time of need.

Khurram has been in pre-trial detention for two years now, on politically motivated charges under an Indian counter-terror law (UAPA) that violates international human rights standards, while Irfan has been in pre-trial detention since March 2023, similarly on politically motivated charges. 

Indian authorities’ persecution of Khurram and Irfan is an emblematic part of their ongoing, systematic criminalization of civil society, and the defense of human rights, in Indian-administered Kashmir. These reprisals and judicial harassment that target them for their human rights work are occurring within a larger context of systematic, longstanding, grave human rights violations by Indian authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir and impunity for those violations.

We call for Indian authorities to adhere to international human rights laws and standards, end the criminalisation of human rights defenders and journalists; and ensure accountability for human rights violations committed by Indian forces in Indian-administered Kashmir.

-Civil Society Collective spends Rs. 18 million in July to provide relief:
Civil Society Collective urges the Government to implement the vaccination plan methodically-

 
Civil Society Collective for Covid-19 Response is a collective of civil society organizations that have come together to contribute to the national Covid-19 response efforts in Sri Lanka.

Relief Operation

In response to the Covid 19 pandemic, the Sri Lanka Civil Society Collective has launched an island-wide relief operation targeting people in need of relief throughout Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Civil Society Collective has already organized a large number of programs for the benefit of people in need throughout the island.  
 
During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, the Civil Society Collective provided food and sanitary supplies to over 500 institutions such as children's homes, elders' homes, women's shelters, centers for persons with disabilities and rehabilitation centers. Therefore, the Collective arranged to distribute aid worth over Rs. 50 million island-wide during the first wave.

Current activities of the Civil Society Collective include providing food and sanitary supplies to poor families vulnerable to health risks in addition to providing the same to care centers and shelters; providing relief by means of telephone hotlines and support centers to women who have been victims of gender-based violence during the pandemic, and who are unable to access other assistance; and raising awareness of the impact of Covid-19 and safety precautions among vulnerable populations. 

Accordingly, the Civil Society Collective has implemented relief operations to support 9551 persons in 330 children's homes, elders' homes, women's shelters, centers for persons with disabilities and rehabilitation centers in 14 districts island-wide in the month of July. Rs. 5 million (Rs.5,200,488.00) was spent on dry rations and Rs. 13 million (Rs. 13,088,802.00) was spent on non-food assistance. Furthermore, we intend to increase the total amount spent on relief to Rs. 40 million by the end of this month. 

In addition to these direct interventions by us, other Civil Society Organizations operating at District level too have continued to provide relief and we have started to collect information regarding these efforts as well. Already, it has been confirmed that assistance exceeding Rs. two hundred and twenty one million (Rs. 221,464,760.00) was distributed last month by Civil Society Organizations operating at national and district levels at present. This still does not portray a complete picture of all their contributions and we intend to provide a more comprehensive image of these contributions in our next update.  

All relief efforts of the Collective are carried out in collaboration with the Government. 

Equality in vaccination: support sought from the international community.

Furthermore, in June, the Collective requested support from diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka to establish equality in vaccination and to provide humanitarian aid for vulnerable families.

This appeal from the CSO Collective has been delivered to Australian, Canadian, Indian, Bangladesh, Malaysian, Netherlands, Pakistan, Romanian, Chinese, Switzerland and British High Commissions and French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norway, Russian, USA Embassies as well as the Country office of the European Union, UN Resident Mission and WHO Country Office.

Health is a fundamental human right. It should not be decided on the basis of power or wealth. Since this disaster takes the form of a global pandemic, we must all unite to overcome this pandemic. Therefore, the Civil Society Collective has pointed out to the international community that vaccines must be distributed among all countries, and that all nations must stand united and collaborate on a long term basis in order to triumph over this pandemic. 

Scientific framework necessary for vaccination drive 

Furthermore, the CSO Collective remains vigilant about the vaccination drive implemented in Sri Lanka.

From time to time, news stories about irregularities in the vaccination programme can be heard. Political interventions too can be seen in the vaccination process. However, the vaccination drive appears to be running a bit more systematically in the past two weeks. The Civil Society Collective expects that vaccination will continue in a systematic and scientific manner. 

Furthermore, the Collective calls upon the Government;
to provide sufficient vaccination for people and to keep the people constantly updated regarding its plans;
to publicize the plan submitted by the government to WHO to receive and administer vaccines donated through the global vaccination donation programme;
to update the current vaccination plan and develop a comprehensive vaccination strategy with the leadership of relevant medical and public health experts;
to ensure that the plan is transparent regarding criteria used for prioritizing districts, divisions and villages and that the public is made aware of it;
to ensure that a scientific consensus is available regarding how people are prioritised when there is a scarcity of vaccines, and to pay particular attention to the at-risk groups;
to ensure that accessibility issues are taken into consideration and special vaccination schemes are put in place for the elderly, pregnant women and persons with special needs (disability);
to formulate a comprehensive communication strategy to ensure that vaccine-related information reaches the public evenly. Utilize television channels, radio channels, newspapers, sms services in Sinhala and Tamil to ensure that comprehensive information on the place and time of vaccination reaches the public;
to conduct public awareness programmes on the importance of vaccination and promptly respond to any misinformation and/or disinformation; 
to increase the number of PCR tests carried out daily as this is instrumental in stemming the spread of the virus, and also to expedite the results of PCR tests as this is useful to control the number of new patients and to minimize the community from being exposed to patients; and
to take leadership in eradicating Covid-19 from Sri Lanka while protecting the most vulnerable groups in society.

The Civil Society Collective has received 546 requests from 276 Children’s Homes, 208 Elder’s Homes, 4 Women’s Shelters, 6 Probation Homes, 32 Care Homes for People Living With Disability (PLWD), 9 groups of Vulnerable/low-income families and 11 other requests from plantation pre-school teachers, sex workers, transgender persons, COVID-19 intermediate care centres, rehabilitation centres, kidney patients etc., across 22 districts, as at 07th July, 2021. 

These requests include 2,871 men and 4,107 women in care homes and 2,753 boys and 4,139 girls in childrens’ care facilities. All together the requests for assistance we have received to date will cover 13,870 people.

Of these 546 requests, we have responded to 173 food related requests to date and are well into the process of responding to the rest. We have in our response so far, covered 60 children’s homes 58 Elders Homes, 7 care homes for PLWD, 5 probation centers and 1 women’s shelter across 14 districts. In addition, we have also responded to requests from 164 vulnerable families from Galle, Gampaha and Kandy. Dry rations have been provided to 3,243 individuals across 10 districts, amounting to Rs. 5,200,488.01.
There has also been several requests for basic hygiene items and safety products from the centers including for masks, sanitizers, thermometers. In response, to date Non Food Relief Items (NFRIs) have been provided to 9,551 individuals from 330 centres (includes Children’s Homes, Elder’s Homes, Women’s Shelters, Probation Homes) across 14 districts, amounting to Rs. 13,088,802.
We are in the process of responding to the balance requests and hope to complete them within this month.
All put together we have so far responded to 537 centers in 22 districts and other vulnerable groups covering 164 people. We hope to have delivered assistance worth of at least 40 million rupees by the end of this intervention.
In addition to our direct intervention we also would like to highlight the work of other civil society organisations - particularly those operating at the district level. We have begun collecting that information as well, and have found that a number of civil society organisations (CSOs), working at both the district and national levels, have stepped up to respond to this crisis. We have so far collected information from across the districts which indicate that around Rs. 221,464,760.22 million worth of assistance has been delivered in the last month by civil society groups. This is only a partial figure, and we hope to collate the contribution by NGOs and other civil society groups more fully and present in our next update.",None,None,None,,Social Media

"Front Line Defenders joins the Martin Ennals Foundation in condemning the harassment of WHRD Soltan Achilova and her daughter by government authorities at Ashgabat airport a few days ago where a customs official took their passports, wet them with a damp rag and declared them to be ruined, obstructing their traveling to Geneva where Soltan would feature as a keynote speaker at the University of Geneva’s Human Rights Week 2023.

Soltan's pictures of daily life are one of the few sources of documentation of human rights violations occurring in this most secretive nation. Her decade-long reporting and documentation of land grabs and forced evictions of local citizens was recognized by the Martin Ennals Award in 2021.

The WHRD believes she was not allowed to leave the country because of the authorities’ fear that negative information might be heard during the Human Rights week in Geneva. Yet, the obstruction from travel of an internationally recognized human rights defender is more striking evidence of the lack of freedoms in the country.  The silencing of Soltan and fellow journalists must stop. We renew calls for Turkmenistan to fully implement their human rights obligations and stop the silencing of human rights defenders.

As Sri Lanka's economic and political crisis deepens, the government has proposed a new Employment Act that would reform 13 existing labor laws. This means extending working hours, eliminating unfair dismissal protections, and limiting union and collective bargaining rights. There are also concerns that the process of reforming labor laws is community-centered and democratic. Specially avoiding the labor advisory council established by the government and resorting to these reforms raises questions about the democratic nature of the process.

Engaging men and boys is pivotal in the prevention of gender-based violence (GBV). By challenging harmful gender norms and fostering positive masculinity, we aim to transform attitudes and promote a culture of equality and respect. Men and boys serve as crucial allies in breaking down barriers, reducing stigma, and encouraging open dialogue about GBV.

Media Release

A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN THE NEW YEAR

Addressing a gathering of religious leaders by Religions for Peace International and its Sri Lankan chapter on December 19, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said that the majority of people do not want another conflict even though politicians cannot resist using the ethnic card.  She insisted the Sri Lankan people were not racist but were provoked by politicians.   She said that public opinion had turned favourable for a political solution based on inter-ethnic power sharing and devolution of power to the provincial level from 23 percent to 68 percent in a matter of two years.  The National Peace Council believes that the present time is opportune for a breakthrough to a political solution.  We recall President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s pledge a year ago that he would ensure a political solution in Sri Lanka’s 75th year of Independence, which is now in its 11th month.  We are pleased that the cabinet has approved two major pieces of legislation to establish a Commission for Truth, Harmony and Reconciliation of Sri Lanka and also to legally establish an Office for National Unity and Reconciliation. These are to be published as government gazette notifications to enable the general public and all interested parties to further submit opinions and proposals in this regard.

The civil society initiative undertaken by the Association of War Affected Women in bringing together an active section of the Tamil Diaspora along with a section of senior Buddhist monks is another positive development that can lay the groundwork for a political solution.  NPC sees this civil society initiative as a first step in bridging the divide between its extremes which can give rise to wider dialogue and deeper understanding.  We are pleased that the Diaspora members and Buddhist monks were able to agree on a joint set of principles necessary to resolve the conflict in an equitable and sustainable manner.  This set of principles was also shared with politicians in parliament and with all major religious clergy and met with their general consent which was also welcomed by members of the diplomatic community as they are universal values demonstrating equality and equity among communities.  There are some who oppose this initiative.  The National Peace Council calls on those holding opposing viewpoints to find ways and means of consolidating it for the common good of the country rather than focusing on their parochial and narrow political interests.

However, we note that on the ground, the large military presence in the North and East even nearly 15 years after the end of the war, and associated surveillance of the security arms of the state, cause unease among the people.   We also note issues of land being claimed for religious and farming reasons by those from outside the Northern and Eastern provinces, which is to the detriment of the people at the ground level.  As a priority the people need a government they can trust, one that will safeguard their land and ensure their personal safety and provide for them a government administration where they could use their language, freely. The provincial councils were meant to do this, and we call on the government to hold those elections without further delay so that people at the provincial level will be governed by those they voted for. As another year ends, a new one begins, we call on the government to address these problems on the ground and instill confidence in the people of the north and east that their economic and justice concerns will be met as an equal people of Sri Lanka.

By engaging diverse youth groups that represent different religious and ethnic communities across the North, South, Central, and East provinces of Sri Lanka, UNFPA has brought together an innovative and participatory intervention with youth - led organizations and networks.

To further advance this effort, the UNFPA Sri Lanka and Alliance Development Trust Sri Lanka are jointly organizing a five-day training program focusing on social cohesion, peacebuilding, gender equality, and reproductive health and rights for youth leaders in the regions of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.

The year was 2013 when Madushka, a seemingly ordinary young man, was kidnapped by a group of unknown individuals. The motive behind his abduction remains shrouded in mystery to this day. No one knows whether he is alive or dead, and this uncertainty has cast a long shadow over his family, especially his wife, Mayuri.

For a decade, Mayuri has been on a relentless quest to uncover the truth about her husband's disappearance. Her determination to find answers has led her on a tumultuous journey, marked by trips to Colombo and vigils that have illuminated the night in Galleface. Each time, she has pleaded for justice, hoping that someone, somewhere, might hold the key to the mystery that has shattered her family.

Yesterday was a pivotal day in Mayuri's journey for justice. She has decided to take her plea to the international stage by visiting the United Nations office in Colombo. Accompanied by her children and a small group of dedicated supporters, Mayuri arrived at the UN office with a written request in hand, seeking global attention to her family's plight.

"M. Ravi, an international human rights lawyer in Singapore, was unjustly sentenced  last week to 21 days in prison for contempt of court. M. Ravi, who has a 20-year history of defending landmark human rights cases, including issues of the death penalty, freedom of expression, and access to legal representation, continues to be judicially harassed for his work. 

The High Court of Singapore found M. Ravi liable for nine instances of contempt, spanning both State Courts and the High Court, all occurring in November 2021. This sentencing comes after a five-year suspension from practice  order issued earlier in March 2023 for making ""grave and baseless accusations of improper conduct"" against the Attorney-General of Singapore, limiting his ability to carry out his crucial work as a human rights lawyer in defense of human rights.

We strongly condemn this sentencing and the suspension order against M. Ravi and believe he is being targeted for his human rights work. We urge Singaporean authorities to reverse these decisions immediately, and ensure human rights defenders can continue their essential work without fear of reprisal.

"Three days ago, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and woman human rights defender Narges Mohammadi was summoned to Evin court for new charges. However, she was banned from attending her own hearing for refusing to wear the mandatory hijab. This marks the seventh time she's faced new charges while in detention since September 2022. Mohammadi has been a tireless advocate for human rights, and was recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight against oppression of women in Iran and her promotion of human rights. ✊🕊️

These charges come days after she ended her hunger srike after being transferred to the hospital, which she had started as a protest against neglectful medical care and the mandatory hijab rule for the women prisoners. Despite her continuous judicial harassment, she persists in her refusal to recognize revolutionary courts and discriminatory veiling rules.

We stand in solidarity with Narges Mohammadi and urge Iranian authorities to drop the unjust charges immediately which are a way of targeting her for her work in defence of human rights.

"IESC’s USDA Food for Progress-funded Market-Oriented Dairy (MOD) project worked with international and local gender specialists to assess women’s engagement in Sri Lanka’s dairy industry. Through key informant interviews and focus group discussions, they discovered several challenges that women in the dairy sector face that should be addressed, such as difficulties in transporting milk to collection centers while balancing household duties. The findings from the study were presented at a seminar with participants from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Animal Production and Health, partner dairy processor companies, banks, civil society organizations, and other public and private sector institutions. Seminar participants created a farmer development model to help women take on an expanded role in the dairy business to earn additional income.

"Prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh's request for bail in relation to her arrest on 29 October, was rejected a few days ago. She was arrested and beaten by police with taser batons along with 23 other women (most of whom have been granted bail) at Armita Geravand's funeral, an Iranian teenage girl who fell into a coma after she was allegedly assaulted by the country’s morality police for not wearing a headscarf. 

She was charged with “disturbing the public order” and “disobeying police order”, and transferred to Qrachak prison where she has been held since. Her lawyer has announced that additional charges of “gathering and colluding against the national security” and “propaganda activities against state” have also been arbitrarily levelled against her, amounting to an utter violation of due process. Additionally, while in detention in Qarchak prison, she received a summons from Branch 1097 of Ershad Judicial Complex. It is still unclear what these most recent charges relate to, but it speculated that it might relate to her refusal to wear her obligatory hijab during the funeral of Armita Geravand.

Front Line Defenders is extremely worried about her continuous judicial harassment. We urge authorities in Iran to immediately and unconditionally release WHRD Nasrin Sotoudeh and quash the convictions against her.

"The Search for Answers : Mayuri's Quest for Justice.

In a country with a rich history and culture, there lies a story that has haunted one family for a decade. The story begins ten years ago when a young man named Madushka was abruptly taken away by unidentified individuals in a white van, leaving behind a trail of questions that still linger unanswered.

The year was 2013 when Madushka, a seemingly ordinary young man, was kidnapped by a group of unknown individuals. The motive behind his abduction remains shrouded in mystery to this day. No one knows whether he is alive or dead, and this uncertainty has cast a long shadow over his family, especially his wife, Mayuri.

For a decade, Mayuri has been on a relentless quest to uncover the truth about her husband's disappearance. Her determination to find answers has led her on a tumultuous journey, marked by trips to Colombo and vigils that have illuminated the night in Galleface. Each time, she has pleaded for justice, hoping that someone, somewhere, might hold the key to the mystery that has shattered her family.

Madushka's children, who were mere infants when their father was taken from them, have now grown into young adults. They too seek to understand what happened to their beloved father. Their innocence lost, they yearn for closure and the chance to piece together the puzzle of their family's shattered life.

Mayuri's Bold Step to the United Nations

Today is a pivotal day in Mayuri's journey for justice. She has decided to take her plea to the international stage by visiting the United Nations office in Colombo. Accompanied by her children and a small group of dedicated supporters, Mayuri arrives at the UN office with a written request in hand, seeking global attention to her family's plight.

A Peaceful Gathering Amidst Heavy Security

Mayuri's approach is peaceful and devoid of protests or confrontations. She and her supporters stand silently in front of the UN Office, holding posters and banners that beseech for justice. Yet, the contrast is stark as a substantial police presence, numbering at least 150 officers, surrounds them, reflecting a fear of the citizens they are meant to protect.

Mayuri's story continues to unfold, a testament to the unyielding spirit of one woman's pursuit of answers, justice, and the restoration of her family's shattered life.

"Leanid Sudalenka, a prominent human rights defender, lawyer, and and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in Belarus, is facing another potential conviction of up to six years in prison, after being targeted with trumped up criminal charges related to ""facilitating extremist activity."" 

Previously, Belarusian authorities labeled his organization, the Homel branch of the Human Rights Centre Viasna, as extremist, putting all those associated with it at risk of targeting and judicial harassment. Sudalenka believes his outspokenness about his past as a political prisoner and the harsh conditions he endured may have also triggered this new case. 

Front Line Defenders believes that he is being targeted as retaliation for his continued human rights work in a state-orchestrated attempt to silence him. Such targeting is a part of the systematic attack against HRDs and organizations in Belarus, ongoing since the August 2020 presidential elections and mass protests that erupted after the election events.

"""Over three decades of unwavering dedication on this estate, starting in 1990 under the stewardship of Nirmala Weerasamy, yet the promises of our rightful benefits remain unfulfilled. We were denied our due allocations of EPF/ETF under her watch. Even in 2015, when the ownership changed hands, the plight of us workers persisted. The new owner failed to honor our entitlements to EPF/ETF and gratuity.

Through the years, our struggles have gone unnoticed and unheard. But today, we stand united to shed light on the injustices we have faced for so long. It's disheartening to admit that the problems persist, even as we work tirelessly to uphold the estate's operations.

In recent times, we have received three letters, each a stark reminder of our precarious situation. The latest letter received just days ago, warns us to return to work within 15 days or face eviction from our homes.

We, the workers of this estate, share this not as a plea for sympathy, but as a call for justice. Our years of hard work and dedication deserve more than empty promises. We strive not just for ourselves, but for the principle that every worker deserves fair treatment and the fulfillment of their rights.

Terrorism is the calculated use of violence to create a general climate of fear in society and bring about a particular political objective. Terrorism has inflicted horrors on people in Sri Lanka and across the world. Terrorism is driven by right-wing and left-wing ideologies, colonialists and nationalists and religious groups, revolutionaries, and even state institutions such as armies, intelligence services, and the police.  This is a description of reality, a statement of fact. Irrespective of the perpetrator's ideology or place in society – their use of fear tactics and violence strikes terror in the heart of the victims and leads to deaths, injuries, and destruction of property. The victims of terrorism are the softest targets – ordinary, unarmed, and unprepared civilians.
The “Wars on Terror” have galvanized whole societies, paradoxically turning them into combatants and into targets. The spectre of terrorism has also provided governments with political capital and the space to operate with impunity to fight terror. Consequently, the numbers of victims of terrorism continue to rise with increased numbers of purveyors of violence.
We in Sri Lanka too, have experienced many bouts and forms of violence. We have given these acts of violence different names at different times. Riots, pogroms, mob violence, street justice, uprisings, and insurrections, expressions of justifiable anger, the heinous crimes of extremists   - radicalized by political ideology or religion, civil war –are some of the words and phrases used to describe events and actions that struck terror into the hearts of victims and led to civilian deaths, injuries and destruction of property. Sri Lanka has seen bouts of violence since 1956 but the violence was not labelled as terrorism. However, from 1979 the word “terrorism” was embedded in our political discourse. But even as we intensified our fight against terrorism, the numbers affected increased.
The use of grenades, land mines, automatic firearms, and willing delivery agents of death – the suicide bombers – have intensified the violence and made acts of terrorism more difficult to contain, anticipate and repel and even comprehend. The common thread is that these acts of violence have targeted innocent civilians for maximum effect.
Remembering victims and honoring the victims, obligates us to do more to provide for a safer, better tomorrow. It obligates us to support survivors of terrorism who are physically and emotionally scarred – perhaps for life.  It obligates us to support the families of terror victims as they too suffer collateral damage.  It also obligates us to seek better ways of protecting civilians while preparing against future attacks. This in turn obligates us to identify the root causes of terrorism and makes efforts to address them. We must also be mindful of the need to protect people within the framework of the rule of law.
Remembrance must go beyond ceremonials. It must be accompanied by concerted actions to provide for a safer, better tomorrow.

"While defending a client, human rights defender Aleksey Ladin was taken into custody in Russian-occupied Crimea for allegedly displaying prohibited symbols on his social media (referring to a Facebook posts he published in 2018 of an image containing “taraq tamga” - the emblem on the Crimean Tatars’ flag) and discrediting the Russian military forces after he reshared a post which denounced Russian aggressions against Ukraine. His house was also  raided at the same time. 

The occupational Crimean department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia also stated that it is planning to disbar Aleksey Ladin. His work as a lawyer has consisted of defending Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar political prisoners in Russian-occupied Crimea, as well as Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians who were abducted and charged with criminal offences by the Russian authorities.

Front Line Defenders condemns the judicial harassment of Aleksey Ladin and believes this to be a clear act of reprisal for his legitimate and peaceful human rights work; and believes the expansion of the Russian Federation's Administrative and Criminal Codes fosters a culture of censorship which is being  disproportionately used to target HRDs working in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

On 11 October, he received phone calls demanding he present himself for questioning in relation to the alleged disappearance of the aforementioned survivor. In the absence of a subpoena, the human rights defender refused to do so.

The Chechen authorities then detained his brother, threatening him, and forcing him to get in touch with Magomed. Fearing for his brothers life, the HRD traveled to Chechnya. On 23 October, the woman he accompanied contacted her relatives in the Chechen Republic to try to deescalate the situation. She then reported that Magomed was present at their house during the call; during the call he addressed her and said “I am at your house, surrounded by your relatives. My life and the life of my family is in danger. They gave me a week for you to return home. If you are not home in a week – they will kill me.” The Crew Against Torture have filed complaints to the Ministry of Interior and to the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation demanding protection for the human rights defender.

"After a combined experiment of National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), SLCDF and community members, has come up with an oyster tumbling machine which is highly efficient low cost hand tool for women oyster farmers in Kalpitiyia area.  
Oyster tumbling machine is mainly used to grade and produce quality oysters on a weekly basis. 
On an experimental level initially a machine was introduced to Praja Sanwardhana Sanvidhanaya Kandakuliya that was equipped with nylon brushes and steel wool brushes. Cleaning mechanism was performed according to the rotating speed and cleaning power of attached brushes. It was manually operated and for easy operation a rotating power gear was included. Water should be poured with buckets (nearly 20L) and oysters loaded from either side of drum. It has the capacity to accommodate nearly 40-50 mature oysters in one cycle. Drain tap was attached to the side for dirty water removal. When testing the machine a few areas for improvement was observed.  
In the improved version of the tumbling machine the inside of the drum and the centre bar are lined with rubber mats which increase cleaning mechanism and protect oyster shells from any physical damage ensuring more safety of mature oysters. Mats having holes help sieve dirt on oysters drained to the tank with soiled water.  
The time previously spent on cleaning the oysters has been reduced by hours for the oyster farming women with the introduction of this handy machine. They see it as user friendly perfectly working machine that has given them extra time for family and other needs.   
This project has been funded by Stichting Gilles of Belgium and implemented with technical assistance from NARA. Similar machines would be provided to the two other community based organizations working under this project in Kalpitiya lagoon area.",Women,Positive,Non Discriminative,,Social Media

Women in Sri Lanka demand economic justice in the face of the ongoing debt crisis 
********************************************
Women’s rights groups in Sri Lanka reject the current debt restructuring solutions that place the burden of repayment on Sri Lanka’s working classes, particularly its women. They are demanding urgent and sustainable solutions to the ongoing debt crisis in Sri Lanka, that respond to the actual lived experiences, struggles, and needs of the people. 
At the ‘National Convening on Debt and Women’s Human Rights’ held in Colombo on 9-10 August 2023, women’s rights groups from Sri Lanka and other Asian countries discussed the ways the ongoing crisis has impacted their lives and the inadequacy of government solutions to respond in meaningful ways. They also severely criticized the historical and current roles played by international financial institutions mainly the World Bank and IMF in imposing unjust austerity measures and their lack of accountability in worsening economic crises in the region. 
Sri Lanka is currently going through a crippling economic crisis because of an unsustainable debt burden of 103.8% of GDP as of March 2023. This crisis hit households at a time when many had not yet recovered from the shocks of COVID-19. The government response of austerity measures to secure an International Monetary Fund bailout are being hurriedly rolled out, with no public consultation. This has included cuts in public spending, steep increases in utility tariffs, food and energy costs, indirect and regressive taxation, and limited cash handouts as social security. 
This has particularly impacted low to middle-income families, and labor laws that threaten to roll back gains in wage and job security, especially for women. Critically, the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to use the earnings of the Employee Provident Funds to repay Sri Lanka’s debt - forcing Sri Lanka’s working class to bear the burden of repaying the wealthiest creditors - and has blocked resistance and legal challenges to the same. 
“The social security funds of workers are being compromised to pay the debt for the richest income earners in the world. The government has decided to trade off the savings - for many of them this is the only savings - of some of the most hardworking people in Sri Lanka,” said lawyer and activist, Lakmali Hemachandra. “There are severe violations going on with the domestic debt restructuring. The restructuring process is due to finish in September and by that time, workers will lose the security of their savings. We need the international community to hear and condemn the fact that creditors are being paid with workers' savings and the Government and IMF is continuing to hold the position that there is people’s buy-in for this. There is no people's buy-in, people just don’t have a way to communicate that,” Hemachandra said.
The Convening reaffirmed that women are disproportionately affected by both the economic crisis and current state solutions to restructure the debt. Due to their unpaid caregiving roles at the household level, women often shoulder responsibilities of ensuring families are fed looked after, and educated, even as they face falling wages, rising food, electricity, and water bills, precarious and informal employment, and lack of access to meaningful social security. “Households can only meet their basic food needs by taking daily loans, weekly loans, and other borrowings at very high-interest rates. We cannot manage basic needs with our income anymore. How is this fair?” said Suganya Kandeepan, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice.     
Social security is not charity but a human right of all people. Women’s groups are demanding that universal social security in this time of crisis be made binding and enforceable by law. Without meaningful expansion of social safety nets and increasing fiscal allocation, targeted schemes like Aswesuma will not benefit the millions of families hit hard by the crisis. “In order to fund universal social security, we demand the government start taxing the rich, taxing corporations and reduce regressive consumer taxes like VAT with immediate effect, and expand budgetary allocation for social security beyond the current limit of 0.6% of GDP. We need to also expand social security to include other forms of support to relieve stress on household debt: guaranteed days of work, weekly nutritional food basket, health and education support, and transport support.” - Sarala Emmanuel, Feminist Collective for Economic Justice. 
Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, Former UN Independent Expert on Debt and Human Rights said, “We also need to question why only domestic creditors have been asked by the government to make a sacrifice and accept, to some extent, a haircut in their credit. External debt holders should also be asked to make a similar contribution to bring sovereign debt to a sustainable level. According to international law, in the Sri Lankan context, prohibition of discrimination means inter-creditor equity in sovereign debt restructuring.”
Sri Lanka is one of several countries in Asia and the Pacific currently grappling with the impacts of a debt crisis. Women’s rights groups across Asia Pacific have expressed solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka, with the Regional Coordinator of APWLD Misun Woo saying, “It is outrageous to hear countless similar stories of violence women go through in a debt crisis.  Women’s stories across Asia and the Pacific confirm that there is a ‘debt formula’ which is a clear manifestation of neo-colonialism and imperialism that takes away peoples’ life, dignity, and sovereign power.  APWLD stands in solidarity with the women and people of Sri Lanka and joins your struggles for justice and freedom. “
The national convening was co-organized by the Law and Society Trust (LST), National Fisheries Solidarity Organisation (NAFSO), The Women and Media Collective (WMC), Colombo Urban Lab, The Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law, and Development (APWLD). Participants included representatives from groups of labor activists, trade unions, rural and urban women, academia, and civil society from Sri Lanka and Asia.

"Reversing the global decline in biodiversity by 2030 requires a budget of USD 722 to 967 billion annually. With only about USD 124 to 143 billion flowing into global biodiversity conservation efforts, this leaves a huge financing gap amounting to USD 711 billion per year. To bridge this gap and demonstrate how nature-positive economies can work for people and the planet, @undp ’s Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) convened over 68 biodiversity finance experts including partners from governments and the private sector from Europe, Asia and Pacific for the 9th Regional Dialogue that took place this week in Sigirya, Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

The Regional Dialogue covered a wide array of finance solutions that unlock finance for nature such as public sector financing, subsidies, results-based budgeting, financial technology, and collaboration with finance and private sectors to finance other effective conservation measures or OECMs, pilot biodiversity credits and bonds, promote nature-financial disclosures, among others, towards the countries’ attainment of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans.

One of these SMEs is TOMECO An Khang, a producer of environmental decontamination equipment, agriculture dryer machines, and industrial fans. TOMECO’s 2020 revenue decreased more than 24% compared to the previous year. To bounce back from these effects, TOMECO’s Chairman, Mr. Kha, attended a workshop held by IESC’s USAID LinkSME project and the Ministry of Planning and Investment on digital transformation. Following this workshop, Mr. Kha registered for additional one-on-one support from the project to develop and implement a comprehensive digital transformation roadmap. With project support, TOMECO has reviewed and developed improvement plans for its current planning and monitoring systems, launched a customer relationship management system to improve engagement of existing customers, adopted a master data management system and cyber security system to speed decision-making and mitigate information security risks, and launched barcodes and traceability programs to track its products through the production process. While TOMECO, its employees, and its customers have benefitted from this transformation, a broader impact is unfolding given the example it is setting for other SMEs, inspiring them to take steps towards digital transformation. #MSMEDay

"Conditions for the abacaleros (manila-hemp workers) of the Japanese-owned company in Ecuador which produces and exports abacá fibre (used for paper money, rope, teabags, cars and more), Furukawa Plantaciones C.A., constituted a violation of the right to equality, non-discrimination, the prohibition of slavery by serfdom, the right to health, housing, education and identity, as Ecuadorian courts established in 2021.

Years later, the workers, including FLD's 2023 Award winner Segundo Ordoñez, are still waiting for reparations, and the delay of the judicial mechanisms mean the Ecuadorian government continues to be exonerated from liability. Meanwhile, the economic and social situation of the abacaleros is increasingly precarious, and they face ongoing threats and harassment.

Front Line Defenders, along other international organizations, call on Ecuadorian authorities to guarantee access to justice and protection of the former Furukawa workers and to address the delay of relevant authorities in examining the case.

At a time when human rights defenders should be valued for their contribution to communities and in promoting human rights and democratic values, they are, instead, facing a pattern of abuse through persecution and intimidation.

Indian authorities must immediately cease attacks on human rights defenders and organizations in India, release those currently imprisoned and enable an environment where defenders are able to carry out their human rights work free from the fear of reprisals.

"The Peruvian Indigenous leader Angel Pedro Valerio, known for defending his territory, and for advocating for indigenous and environmental rights in the face of drug trafficking mafias, illegal logging and land grabbing in the Ashaninka territory, is facing an investigation and preliminary arrest order for his alleged involvement in the disappearance of four people in April 2023.

His defense claims that he has been unjustly accused as he was not present in the area in the moment of the disappearance, which took place in the context of a protest for the killing of another Ashaninka indigenous leader. It is clear that there is a need for an independent investigation to clarify this very serious case; nevertheless, Front Line Defenders believes the investigation has been weaponised as an opportunity to undermine Pedro Valerio’ work as a human rights defender.

Front Line Defenders urges Peruvian authorities to respect his right to presumption of innocence and to drop the warrant for his arrest while an impartial investigation is carried out.

"Yesterday, the Supreme Court of Belarus upheld Nasta Loika’s seven years imprisonment sentence for “incitement of racial, national, religious or other social enmity or discord”. Since her detention a year ago, she has been systematically denied the exercise of her rights in prison through bans on personal correspondence and inhumane treatment (including physical and psychological violence). They have also targeted her lawyers,  hindering her right to defense.

Nasta Loika, named as a woman human rights defender of 2022 by Belarus Human Rights House, works in human rights education. Her work includes addressing repressive “anti-extremist” laws and advocating for the protection of migrants and the rights of stateless people in Belarus.

Front Line Defenders condemns the decision to uphold her sentence, which reflects a wider trend of increased targeting of human rights defenders and civil society by Belarus authorities.

- Quote in text - 

""The High Commissioner's Report gives a glimpse behind the facade put up to cover the deepening impunity, systematic repression of dissent, continuing violation of human rights in war-affected regions, and deepening economic inequalities in the country. Nearly 15 years after the end of the war, victims continue to wait for justice. The recent proposal of a Truth and Reconciliation mechanism, like successive commissions set up by the Government, appears to be designed to shield those implicated in war crimes and crimes against humanity, from criminal accountability, whilst keeping the Council and international community distracted. Similarly, the failure to credibly investigate the Easter Sunday bombings, including recent revelations about the complicity of the State security apparatus, leaves little room for public confidence in domestic mechanisms. Furthermore, the continued harassment of human rights defenders, activists, as well as Tamils and Muslims and families of disappeared and others in the North and the East, shows the Government's lack of commitment to systematic reforms demanded by protestors. This is demonstrated by the proposal to supposedly reform the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act through equally draconian laws. In the absence of accountability through domestic mechanisms, the Council remains an important avenue of hope and justice for victims of past atrocities and successive Governments. Therefore, the Council must strengthen and expand the accountability project, as well as the monitoring and reporting mandates of the country."" -

"Front Line Defenders and others have pulled out from the EU-ASEAN Human Rights Dialogue after Myanmar Junta Representatives were invited to participate: 

""We deeply regret the invitation of junta representatives, which contradicts the approach taken by both the EU and ASEAN in reaction to the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar that overturned the November 2020 general elections and the junta’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities, as well as on civil society groups, human rights defenders, trade unions, journalists, and political opponents. We reject in the strongest possible terms any effort that may be perceived as legitimising the junta.""

At the protest, he demonstrated alongside others who expressed their discontent with the Georgian government's foreign policy and Georgia’s growing alliance with Russian authorities. He was acquitted on a separate charge of disobeying a legal order from the police.

"IESC’s USDA Food for Progress-funded Agricultural Trade and Climate Smart Innovation (ATraCSI) project’s horticultural value chain assessment (HVCA) team traveled throughout El Salvador to collect primary data, conduct stakeholder interviews, and analyze findings. Napoleon Castillo, Deputy Chief of Party in El Salvador, and Bettina Balmer, HVCA Team Leader, met with Comercializadora 503, a Salvadoran company that produces and distributes nostalgic food products. Together they discussed opportunities and obstacles related to imports and exports to improve trade facilitation. These discussions will help IESC tailor ATraCSI’s interventions to the specific needs of project participants in El Salvador.",None,Positive,Non Discriminative,,Social Media
"Today, just a few days after the second anniversary of their arrest, the trial of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing will begin. They were formally arrested on the charge of ‘inciting subversion of state power’ but their continued detention is believed to be related to their weekly gatherings organized to discuss the challenges activists face due to the shrinking space for civil society in the country. 

Sophia Huang Xueqin is a journalist who has been involved in several #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to survivors of sexual assault and harassment. Also a prominent supporter of the #MeToo movement in China, labour activist Wang Jianbing has provided legal support for people with disabilities and workers with occupational diseases. 

Front Line Defenders, along with other civil society groups, call on the Chinese government for the immediate and unconditional release of these two human rights defenders and their unrestricted access to family, lawyers, adequate and necessary medical treatment, and protection from torture and other ill-treatment.

"As the one year anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, and Iran's #WomanLifeFreedom movement approaches, we highlight emblematic cases of women human rights defenders who are still imprisoned, not only for their human rights work during the protests, but for their work defending human rights even preceding the protests.

Although one year has passed since the start of the protests in the wake of Mahsa Amini’s death, and the international community’s attention to the crisis has somewhat faded, human rights defenders remain at heightened risk and continue to endure human rights violations.

We stand with the human rights defenders that continue to face harassment, targeting, arrest and imprisonment and we call for the immediate release of those who are imprisoned on trumped charges.
